The "when push comes to shove" ideology, in this case, is absurd as it is hardly fathomable how an ordinary person lacking the profile of a killer would commit the act.

However, her parents did not stay together as they divorced before Dee Dee gave birth.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cbc3959961e04aba.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fred Grabbe's story: Background, what happened, and where is he today?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Dee Dee got pregnant when she was 24 years old while Rob was 17. They came up with Gypsy because Dee Dee liked it, and Rob was a fan of <i>Guns N' Roses</i>.</p><p class=align-left>Despite their separation, Rob attempted to keep in touch with his daughter, but his ex-wife always found a way of keeping them apart in many ways. Rob also regularly paid $1200 in child support to Dee Dee.</p><p class=align-left>Gypsy's mother claimed that she suffered from Leukemia, asthma, muscular dystrophy, and other medical conditions. On top of this, Dee Dee claimed that Gypsy suffered mental damage because of her premature birth and had the mental capacity of a seven-year-old.</p><p class=align-left>The strangest thing is that Gypsy had used a wheelchair since 8 years old. This happened after getting a knee injury from a motorcycle fall. However, her injuries were not severe to keep her in the wheelchair, and her mother lied to her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7218c017dc03a45d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Skylar Neese: The tragic story of the teen murdered by her friends</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Also, Gypsy stopped going to school after the second grade.

The Habitat for Humanity even built a small house for them with features like lower light switches, a large bathtub and numerous other things suitable for someone disabled.</p><p class=align-left>On top of this, Dee Dee attended charity trips to Disney <a href=#>World</a> and, via Make-a-Wish Foundation, met Miranda Lambert. Since Gypsy's mother believed that her daughter was ill, she treated her for different ailments and even got her prescription drugs for anti-seizure and surgeries.</p><p class=align-left>However, later in life, things started to come out. At some point, Dr. Bernardo Flasterstein, Gypsy's neurologist, became suspicious of her muscular dystrophy diagnosis. After conducting further tests, he discovered that Gypsy did not have any abnormalities.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cdcdb09edb7f16c3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The story of Bernadette Protti: Everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Having this in mind, the doctor suspected a case of Munchausen syndrome by proxy whereby a caregiver creates the appearance of health problems, often their child.

She met Nicholas from Big Bend, Wisconsin, online on a Christian dating website. Nicholas had been diagnosed with autism. The two became fond of one another and even spoke of eloping and having a child together.</p><p class=align-left>They kept their relationship secret for two and half years before Gypsy confided to her friend, Aleah Woodmansee, in 2014. However, Aleah saw that <a href=#>the relationship</a> was strange since Gypsy was a minor.</p><p class=align-left>Blanchard never liked Dodejohn, and it created a big issue at home with her daughter.
