<time>24 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>It was once a pub sport, now it's a millionaire's game.</p><p>That is, obviously, only if you make the very top of the pile. Thanks to the phenomenal rise of the PDC over the past 20 years, those at the oche's top table can now make hundreds of thousands of pounds each year.</p><p>Going into this year's <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Paddy Power World Championship</a>, three players in Michael Smith, Michael van Gerwen and Luke Humphries all had over £1million to their name on the Order of Merit, meaning they had seven-figure scores in the past two years alone.</p><p><b>READ MORE:</b><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Luke Littler offered free kebabs for life if he wins PDC world darts crown</a></b></p><p><b>READ MORE:</b><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Luke Humphries hits out at Ally Pally darts crowd and calls them 'one of worst ever'</a></b></p><p>But for people like MVG, who have been around the circuit for over a decade, the money has added up significantly. Van Gerwen has even been able to buy himself a Rolls Royce in recent times.</p><p>But who are the top earners in darts history? Well, it's tough to account for every single penny, but we have managed to cover every single PDC televised major event - ultimately where the big money is won - and here is the top 10, with figures correct up until prior to the 2024 Paddy Power World Darts Championship.</p><h3>10. Rob Cross - £1,484,250</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article26045177.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-900354226.jpg><p>Over a third of Rob Cross' entire career earnings came when he shocked the world to win the 2018 World Darts Championship, but he has proven it was more than just a flash in the pan.</p><p>He also has the World Matchplay to his name, plus two European Championship crowns and a raft of other finals, which makes him one of the most successful players of the modern era.</p><h3>9. Raymond van Barneveld - £1,558,250</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28806612.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_barneybird.jpg><p>There's not much more that can be said about Raymond van Barneveld that hasn't been said already. He is perhaps unlucky that his trophy-laden career did not come 10 years later when the prize money started to boom.</p><p>Still, it does not stop Barney getting into the top 10 highest-earners of all-time... and you can bet your bottom dollar that he has been earning a quid or two from endorsements and exhibitions too.</p><p><b><i>Who is your favourite darts player? Let us know in the <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>comments section</a>.</i></b></p><h3>8. Adrian Lewis - £1,760,250</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30563588.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_lewis1jfif.jpg><p>Adrian Lewis took a step back from darts this year but can certainly afford to do so. His two world titles in the early 2010s helped make him one of the most successful darts players of his generation.</p><p>There is no doubting that Lewis has one of the smoothest and most aesthetically-pleasing throws on the tour, so hopefully some time away can help him find his mojo again for a return to the oche.</p><h3>7. Michael Smith - £2,026,000</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article29729025.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Smith3.jpg><p>Darts' nearly man is finally <i>the </i>man after securing the PDC World Darts Championship last year and putting to bed years of losing finals and hurt. His bank balance is healthier for it too.</p><p>Smith admitted this winter that he wears £700 trainers on the stage after treating himself with his £500k winnings from the Worlds. He's also had holiday of a lifetime in Vegas... and who can blame him? Enjoy the moment...</p><h3>6. Gerwyn Price - £2,071,750</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25697338.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1294034375.jpg><p>It has been a bit of a year to forget by Gerwyn Price's supremely high standards, but he won't mind too much, it's not like he is fighting for his earnings on the Order of Merit.</p><p>He made the final of this year's World Grand Prix but has struggled to replicate the form he showed in lockdown when he won the Worlds. But he's been able to invest his money wisely and having previously been a builder, has paid for the ultimate lad's pad at his Wales home with his winnings.</p><h3>5. James Wade - £2,296,750</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29710825.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_WhatsApp-Image-2023-04-06-at-120112.jpg><p>James Wade is perhaps the most impressive name on this list, simply for the fact he has never played in the biggest-money match of them all in the PDC World Championship final.</p><p>He does have a number of semi-finals but it's his career long consistency that makes him all the more impressive. He's had something of a good year, too. Despite busting out of this year's Worlds at the first hurdle, he previously made three major televised quarter-finals in a row for the first time since 2011. Whisper it, but Wadey might be back.</p><h3>4. Gary Anderson - £2,617,750</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31691789.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS319746194jpge-W.jpg><p>If he can be bothered to play, Gary Anderson is still a threat to anyone on the PDC tour. But he's built a career and legacy for himself whereby he doesn't have to play every event on the calendar anymore.</p><p>Two winning World finals, two losing ones and over £2.6million in the bank. Put your feet up Gary, you've earned it.</p><h3>3. Peter Wright - £2,923,250</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article25834462.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS202244359.jpg><p>It's a good job he's decent at darts because who knows how much his hairdressing bill would end up costing without his near-£3million in winnings.</p><p>He bombed out of the World Championship this month at the first time of asking but we can't let that mask the fact he has had one of the better years of anyone on the major tour. His £165,000 of winnings, which include the European Championship crown, is only eclipsed by Luke Humphries this year, who himself will surely be on the all-time earners list sooner rather than later.</p><h3>2. Phil Taylor - £4,434,000</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30489700.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Phil-Taylor.jpg><p>If Phil Taylor played with today's prize money, he would be away and clear. This year, the winner will take home £500,000 if they win the tournament. When Taylor won his first PDC title in 1995, he bagged £12,000. If he had today's money, he would have made £8million simply from the PDC World Championship finals he reached, never mind the 42 other titles he won that contribute to these monetary totals.</p><p>Taylor has carefully invested his money in property over the years - once allegedly owning around 15 houses - so his net worth is sure to have rocketed since.</p><h3>1. Michael van Gerwen - £5,295,250</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31768784.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Screenshot-2023-12-29-at-141704-copy.jpg><p>The greatest player of the big-money generation and a multiple winner of every single tournament on the PDC calendar. Despite that, MVG only has three titles at the Worlds, which means that his earnings are perhaps a little shorter than they could have been.</p><p>Van Gerwen is no stranger to spending money, however. He loves his supercars and loves a luxury holiday - and who can blame him when he is the highest-earner in PDC history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Oaqa2rX6WxpHnDmqmtq12pvLWty2anq6Gqmnquu82esGZrYWyDd4GVbg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpdc-darts-total-prize-money-31766565.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpdc-darts-total-prize-money-31766565.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpdc-darts-total-prize-money-31766565.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpdc-darts-total-prize-money-31766565.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpdc-darts-total-prize-money-31766565.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpdc-darts-total-prize-money-31766565.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./royal-style-watch-march-2024-duchess-sophie-princess-anne.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./royal-style-watch-march-2024-duchess-sophie-princess-anne.html>Royal Style Watch: from Queen Camilla's tribute to the late Queen to Princess Charlene's disco fever</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kourtney-kardashian-showcases-bourgeoning-bump-bikini-babymoon-luxury-resort-kauai-html.html>Kourtney Kardashian showcases bourgeoning bump in bikini during babymoon to luxury resort in Kauai</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kourtney-kardashian-showcases-bourgeoning-bump-bikini-babymoon-luxury-resort-kauai-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
