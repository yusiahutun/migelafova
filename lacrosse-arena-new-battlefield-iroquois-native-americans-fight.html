We are third in the world in field lacrosse, second in indoor lacrosse, we’ve won 11 medals of late. Our expectation is that we will be in the World Games so we are in negotiations with World Lacrosse and other international bodies,” added Nolan, who thanked the Hong Kong and China associations for their support.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/08/17/8b609b5e-dd3c-11ea-b1d3-42d340dc91a3_972x_092619.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sport is often described as a “religion” in some countries – football in Brazil and cricket in India. For the Haudenosaunee, lacrosse was a gift from the Creator and leaving them out of the World Games is like denying them their right to worship.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Board member Rex Lyons, a former player who is of the Onondaga Nation, said lacrosse is an integral part of Iroquois spirituality.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Once you’re involved in it, it’s a lifestyle,” said Lyons, who was part of the first Iroquois Nationals team from 1983. “Lacrosse is part of our cosmology, a huge part of our culture and has a very spiritual aspect to it. And that’s one of the things we bring to the table in its healing and medicinal qualities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A lot of the issues we run up against are hundreds of years old. We’ve been going down this river trying to be self-determined. You don’t ask permission to be sovereign. You are as sovereign as you are.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So we produce our own passports, this is our travel document, take it or leave it. We were offered dual citizenship with the US, and of course, you can’t have a treaty with yourselves so we said, ‘thanks but no thanks’.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We always stick to our fundamental principle of who we are, of being self-determined and lacrosse has been a very extraordinary vehicle for us to implement our sovereignty.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/08/17/0c5fcb46-dd22-11ea-b1d3-42d340dc91a3_1320x770_092619.JPEG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Iroquois are among the most influential Native American confederacies in the US and Canada. They comprise six nations – Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, Seneca and Tuscarora. They have their own language, their own passports and enjoy sovereign nation treaties with the likes of the UK, the Netherlands, France and the US.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Iroquois boast some of the best lacrosse players in the world, led by the Thompson brothers Lyle, Miles, Jerome and Jeremy, with 27-year-old Lyle holding the record for most points in the US Division 1 competition. A World Games without such quality players would diminish its value, something that the Hong Kong and China lacrosse bodies acknowledge.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[The] HKLA recognises the Iroquois Nationals and the Haudenaosaunee people as both the originators of lacrosse and as the true ambassadors of the sport,” the HKLA said in a statement. “The way we experience the game today is a result of the generosity and willingness of the Haudenosaunee people to share their game with the world. Excluding the Iroquois Nationals from the 2022 World Games reflects a disregard for these ideals of inclusivity, that are so fundamental to the culture of lacrosse.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dave Bray, a board member from the Seneca Nation, said a petition to put the Iroquois Nationals into the World Games was launched in early July by a Native American in Nova Scotia, Canada. It has since been signed by around 50,000 people.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have worldwide support, we’ve had statements of support coming in from the US, Canada, Latvia, Hong Kong and China and it’s been awesome to get these letters,” Bray said. “So we’re working with World Lacrosse, with World Games, to get us included into the World Games.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Through these efforts we’re hoping it will be done soon. We are optimistic, we are diplomatic, we are working with them, explaining, re-educating people about our distinctness, our sovereignty.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our government is probably one of the oldest governments in the world, and certainly, we represent, in some respects, indigenous people around the world,” Bray added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hong Kong national coach Chad Fairfoull was born just south of the Six Nations, which straddles the border of Canada and US on the east. He said a World Games without the Iroquois Nationals would be meaningless.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/08/17/9d34bdc6-df01-11ea-b1d3-42d340dc91a3_600x_092619.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The whole lacrosse community wants them to play in all world lacrosse events,” Fairfoull said. “Because we all know that that’s were the game came from, that’s the history and for them to not be eligible to us makes no sense.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They are number three in the world and that’s amazing considering they have maybe 500 players, probably closer to 300, a very small pool of players compared to Canada, which has 20,000 and the US, which has 200,000.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the Haudenosaunee, it goes back to the stick and the way their players embrace it through life and death, whereas for others it is merely functional.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The stick represents everything that exists on Earth that they need to play “the Creator’s game” – from the hickory tree that provides the wood to the interlocking weaves on the netting that connects human, animal and the plant kingdoms and holds the ball, which administers the medicine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The sacred stick, for the Haudenosaunee, is more than a piece of sports equipment. It is their birthright, it’s what they cling on to when confronting life’s trials and it remains firmly in grasp when they go to their graves.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have world-class players even though we have a very small pool,” Lyons said. “It’s because we grew up with a stick in our hand.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mqKyYmr9uv8%2Boqa1nkafBqq%2FLnmZsaGlsgnWEjqWYnKqfqMCmecCrnKeZXaOyuHnBmqutpJWbtqa4w2agq6ehqryqv4ynmK2hppp6ornEq6CcmZ6oeqe1xqGr</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flacrosse-arena-new-battlefield-iroquois-native-americans-fight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flacrosse-arena-new-battlefield-iroquois-native-americans-fight.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flacrosse-arena-new-battlefield-iroquois-native-americans-fight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flacrosse-arena-new-battlefield-iroquois-native-americans-fight.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flacrosse-arena-new-battlefield-iroquois-native-americans-fight.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flacrosse-arena-new-battlefield-iroquois-native-americans-fight.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./maisie-williams-shaved-head.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./maisie-williams-shaved-head.html>Maisie Williams' Shaved Head Makes Its Instagram Debut</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-and-why-to-change-your-mac-address-on-windows-linux-and-mac.html>How (and Why) to Change Your MAC Address on Windows, Linux, and Mac</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-and-why-to-change-your-mac-address-on-windows-linux-and-mac.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
