At the New York City premiere earlier this week, the star was honored with a tribute reading: “In memory of Patrick Swayze whose legacy of strength and greatness reminds us all to BE NICE.”</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-534292874-809x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-patrick-swayze-s-heartbreaking-final-words>Patrick Swayze’s heartbreaking final words</h2><p>The Dirty Dancing star met his wife writer and director Lisa Niemi, when he was just 18 years old. They went on to marry in 1975 but never had any children.</p><p>They locked eyes at his mother’s dance studio, and after high school they moved to New York and landed spots at the Joffrey Ballet.</p><p>Broadway’s Grease director, Tom Moore, said they were the “perfect couple”.</p><p>His wife, who was a talented dancer, is known to have inspired Swayze’s Dirty Dancing soundtrack song She’s Like The Wind.</p><p>In her 2011 book, titled Worth Fighting For, she shared the <a href=#>couple’s</a> final words to each other.</p><p>“My last words to Patrick? ‘I love you’, and those were his last words to me.” she wrote</p><p>In 2009, not long after the star’s tragic death, Lisa said she wished she’d told Patrick she loved him more often while speaking at the Maria Shriver’s women’s conference.</p><p>“I am so grateful for what I had and my connection to him, and part of me believes that I will see him again,” she said.</p><p>The <a href=#>movie</a> star would gush over his wife through interviews, showing how the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> were always on cloud nine when it came to love.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> People in 2007: “I knew she was the smartest chick I’d ever met in my life.</p><p>“For a long time I didn’t feel like I deserved her.”</p><p>The duo not only were together off-screen but worked together in <a href=#>Hollywood</a>. They co-wrote and acted alongside each other in a play, which later became the 2003 film One Last Dance, which Lisa directed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lisa-s-role-in-dirty-dancing>Lisa’s role in Dirty Dancing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1342983274-1024x848.jpg><p>Dirty Dancing, one of Patrick’s biggest films of his career, also saw Lisa support him as he prepared for the role.</p><p>They’d practice the routines over and over, and conduct rehearsals in a hotel room while filming.</p><p>He said: “She was there a lot because I depend on Lisa.</p><p>“My most important rehearsals were with Lisa in a hotel room. We’d practice over and over and over.”</p><p>Patrick added: “Lisa and I have built just about every character I’ve done. You have to understand, we have an ease … I’d been married a long time when I did Dirty Dancing, and it just gave me so much to bring.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-d-fly-him-to-his-treatments>She’d fly him to his treatments</h2><p>After Patrick was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, Lisa would fly him to his chemotherapy treatments at Stanford University. The pair were both licensed pilots and often flew in the skies together.</p><p>At the time, doctors thought he had a positive prognosis, but sadly, 18 months after being told the news, his health took a turn for the worst.</p><p>Aged 57, Patrick Swayze died of the disease with his wife Lisa by his side.</p><p>They had been married for 34 years.</p><p>Lisa, reflecting on his death, said: “I like to think he knew I was there.</p><p>“I was always afraid I’d freak out. To have your soulmate leave you, it was definitely overwhelming, but at the same time, I knew he was in a better place because he had used every ounce of that body.</p><p>“It was holding him down, and he needed to leave it behind. And that was very, very clear to me in the end.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gyllenhaal-said-lisa-and-patrick-were-so-supportive>Gyllenhaal said Lisa and Patrick were ‘so supportive’</h2><p>Jake Gyllenhaal and Patrick Swayze first met when they worked together on the sci-fi thriller, Donnie Darko, as he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Entertainment Tonight at the Road House remake premiere he had always been ‘so supportive.’</p><p>“I mean, from the jump, from the moment I met Patrick – we worked on the [2001] movie Donnie Darko – and from all the scenes we filmed and throughout the years, him and his wife, Lisa [Niemi] – and even Lisa to this day – have been just loving and supportive,” he said, calling them a “beautiful couple”.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Nightcrawler star took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to honor the star.</p><p>In a throwback photo, the star penned: “I’ve never stopped being a fan.</p><p>“He was such a talent and I continue to have so much respect and admiration for what he put out into the world. I’ll never forget his kindness to me when I was starting out— he didn’t have to take the time, but he always did.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2d%2BcLzAramim5tiwLit2LOcrGWWnruiuIytn6udlWLEsL7DrGSwmaNirm68xKudnpukYrK5rcypo55ln5t6qbvWZp%2BeZZyew6awjKGgrGWcnrOmew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpatrick-swayzes-final-three-words-was-a-perfect-example-of-how-he-lived-his-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpatrick-swayzes-final-three-words-was-a-perfect-example-of-how-he-lived-his-life.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpatrick-swayzes-final-three-words-was-a-perfect-example-of-how-he-lived-his-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpatrick-swayzes-final-three-words-was-a-perfect-example-of-how-he-lived-his-life.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpatrick-swayzes-final-three-words-was-a-perfect-example-of-how-he-lived-his-life.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpatrick-swayzes-final-three-words-was-a-perfect-example-of-how-he-lived-his-life.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./celebrity-kansas-city-chiefs-fans-taylor-swift-paul-rudd-and-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./celebrity-kansas-city-chiefs-fans-taylor-swift-paul-rudd-and-more.html>Celebrity Kansas City Chiefs Fans: Taylor Swift, Paul Rudd and More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nancy-mckeon-s-has-two-children-having-a-good-time-with-her-husband.html>Nancy McKeon's Has Two Children: Having a Good Time With Her Husband</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nancy-mckeon-s-has-two-children-having-a-good-time-with-her-husband.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
