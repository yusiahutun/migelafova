In 1997, he released his debut studio album <strong>“Harlem World”.</strong></p><p>Additionally, he made appearances on a number of songs by different musicians.

When licensing deals weren’t going his way the rapper quit his Bad Boy label. Up until the 2020 Grammy relations between the two remained friendly.</p><p>In his acceptance speech, Diddy, who received the Icon Award for his achievements in the business, criticized the Grammy Awards for undervaluing black artists. Mase posted on Instagram in a since-deleted post to rip his former label boss.</p><p>It was over the unjust treatment he endured while signed to Bad Boy, despite the fact that many artists found Diddy’s statements to be inspiring. He claimed that he made Diddy an offer of $2 million in cash to buy back his publishing rights.</p><p>He had given to Diddy 24 years before for only $20,000. In 2022, he appears to have taken another shot at the mogul, releasing Oracle 2: The Liberation of Mason Betha targeting Diddy.
