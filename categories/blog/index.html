According to the Nashville Tennessean, Trinity Broadcasting Network bought the property a year later, and it was most recently being used to film Huckabee before a tornado swept the area in December and directly impacted the structural integrity of the former mansion.</p><footer><a href=../../conway-twitty-nashville-mansion-twitty-city-demolition.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../frank-ocean-10-years-channel-orange.html>Frank Ocean's 'Channel Orange' Revisited, 10 Years Later</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

Related Storyエンジェルナンバーには様々な形があり、それぞれユニークな意味を持つ。例えば、2はつながりを意味し、8は達成とバランスを、5は冒険や変化への準備を示している可能性がある。
マインドフルネスやメンタルヘルスを促進するウェルネスアプリSoaakのチーフイノベーションオフィサーを務めるローラ・ウィドニー氏は、スピリチュアル的には、4という数字は私たちを導き、励まし、ポジティブなエネルギーや自信、内なる強さを与えてくれると説明する。ウィドニー氏が言うように、特定の数字が繰り返し現れるとき、それは何らかサインであり、その意味深いメッセージに心を開き、受け入れるよう促されているのだ。
本記事では、4、44、444といった数字が示すメッセージと、それらに出会ったときにどのように行動するべきなのか、専門家の解説をご紹介。 数字の4が持つスピリチュアルな意味スピリチュアルな意味で数字の4がもたらす教訓は、夢や目標、願望に関係している。占星術の専門家によれば、私たちが望むものを達成するためには、進んで奉仕し、人から頼られ、一貫した努力をしなければならないとのこと。
数字の4は、空気、火、水、土の4つの要素を表すことができる。これらは、目標を達成するために協力することの重要性を意味する、とウィドニー氏。
また、4は東西南北の4つの方角を表すこともあるそう。ウィドニー氏によると、これは「私たちはすべてつながっており、目標や願望を達成するためには他者を尊重し、配慮する必要がある」ということを思い出させるもの。
ベリー氏によれば、数字の4の目的は、勤勉に働くことで、真に価値あるものを築くことだという。「何かを達成する責任を負ったり、自分を律することやルールの価値を理解したりすることで得られる、秩序や安心感の重要性を示しています」。 atakan//Getty Images
4、44、444が意味するものサイキックセラピストで、スピリチュアル講師であるヴィンセント・ジェンナ氏によれば、「4という数字のサインは、私たちが重要な導きを必要としていることを意味しています」。もしかすると、本来の人生の道から外れていて、軌道修正する必要があることもありえるということ。 4：人生が混沌としていたり、行き詰まりを感じていたり、試練の時に4の数字が見えたら、立ち止まって冷静になるように促されているメッセージ。地に足をつけ、一度立ち止まり、振り返るべき。逆に、目標を達成しているときに4の数字が見えたら、その歩みを肯定されているメッセージだとジェンナ氏は言う。「例えば、時計の4時44分、レシートの4、ラジオや会話で繰り返し同じ数字を聞くかもしれません」。ウィドニー氏によれば、「4という数字は、目標達成に向けて調和を保ちながら懸命に努力することを促してくれます。数字の4が持つ安定性は、願望を達成するために必要な集中力と生産性を思い出させてくれるものです」。ベリー氏にとって数字の4は、私たちがサポートを受け、助けられていることを意味する。「導きを信頼し、心の強さを持って献身を続けるようにと教えてくれるものです」。
44：4が2つ重なると、天の関与が2倍になる、とベリー氏は指摘する。「44という数字は、愛と保護が私たちを包み、安全を確保することを示しています。また、愛に満ちた導きによって、真実を伝えられているともいえます」。ウィドニー氏によると、「エンジェルナンバーの44は、私たちの今の歩みや決断が成功へ続いているため、直感に従い、今の道を続けるように促すものです」 とのこと。444：ベリー氏によると444は奇跡が起きている証拠で、「物事が好転し、障害が取り除かれているこをと示します」とのこと。困難を克服したり、より良い変化を起こすためには努力が必要で、「444は、望ましいゴールに到達するためには、努力をしなければならないことを思い出させてくれるもの」でもあるとのこと。また、「エンジェルナンバー444は、非常にパワフルなメッセージです」とウィドニー氏。「444という数字は、愛と完全性のサインでもあります。私たちが深い愛情を持つことを表しています」。恋愛における4の意味恋愛に関して言えば、4という数字が3回繰り返されるのは、その関係を安定させるよう告げているメッセージ。「たとえ現在は性的な存在であったとしても、いずれソウルメイトやツインフレームのような関係に発展するためには、肉体的な関係だけでなく感情的なつながりを築かなければならないのです。これは性別を問わず、私のクライアントにいつも言っていることです」とジェンナ氏。
肉体的なつながりも重要である一方で、安定が二人の関係を長続きさせるもの。エンジェルナンバー4が見えたら、今の恋愛に安らぎを見出す必要があることを意味しているのかもしれない。「決断を下し、今後の方向性を確立するとともに、平和を見出すことが重要です」とベリー氏。

最近新しい恋愛を始めたのなら、数字の4を含むエンジェルナンバーは、その関係を安定したものにする必要性を意味している、とジェンナ氏。「強い関係を築くことで、人生を通してやってくる様々なストレスに耐えられることを覚えておいてください。良い時も悪い時も、強固で安定した関係が築かれていれば、どんな問題も乗り越えられるものです」。 ツインフレームと4の関係ツインフレームとは、私たちの魂を分かち合う運命の相手。「ツインソウルは、もともと一つの魂だった運命の相手。ツインソウルと出会うことで、自分の長所や短所を相手に見出し、より早く成長することができるのです」。
ベリー氏によれば、ツインフレーム の友情や恋愛関係とは、それぞれが相手の良い部分を映し出し、自分の本当の価値を思い出させるような魂の結びつきのこと。秘密がなく、肯定的なフィードバックと建設的な批判があるような、誠実で無償の関係だそう。
つまり、4、44、444という数字が見えたら、それはパートナーと正しくポジティブな方向に向かっているサイン。「内なる直感を信じることが、関係を前進させる上で重要だということを示しています」とベリー氏。
このコンセプトに従えば、ツインフレームとの関係は、実は最も難しい種類であるといえる。「自分自身とうまくやっていくのが難しいなら、自分自身の写し鏡のようなパートナーと、うまくやっていくのはもっと難しいでしょう？」とジェンナ氏。「あなたが抱えている問題や弱点が何であれ、それを解決するのは2倍に難しいこととなるでしょう」。 金銭面やキャリアにおける4の意味「444という数字は、キャリアの目標を達成するために必要な集中力と決断力を維持してくれるもの。そのおかげで、金銭面も後押ししてくれます」とウィドニー氏。
4は、自立していて、実践的なエネルギーを放つ数字。数字の4は、自ら規律や秩序を保ち、お金の問題や仕事に関してより意欲的になることを示すサイン。「4は、仕事やキャリアにおける卓越性を重んじる数字です。4が現れたら、粘り強さや正確さをさらに持って仕事に取り組むべきです」とベリー氏。
ジェンナ氏によれば、数字の4は、”このまま進みなさい”、”正しい道にあなたを導いてくれる”というメッセージであることもあれば、実は新しい仕事が必要だというメッセージであることもあるという。正しい道へと導かれるよう、サインを探し続けて。 健康面における4の意味
エンジェルナンバーの4は、健康を優先する必要があるというサイン。4が現れたら、健康面にも規律をもたらす必要があるかもしれない。特に周囲のエネルギーが混沌としている場合、4という数字を見ることは、自分自身を落ち着かせ、スローダウンし、穏やかな感覚を持つように導かれているといえる。「より良い人生は、健康を維持することによって実現するのです。肉体を癒すためには、何よりもまず精神体を癒す必要があるというメッセージです」とジェンナ氏。
エンジェルナンバーを体験した時に、自分の考えや感情について書いたり、日記を残したりするのがよいとウィドニー氏は言う。「エンジェルナンバーを見ている時期に日記を書くことで、パワフルな瞬間を最大限に活用することに役立ちます」。

The report was published in the last week.
The epidemic in 2011 was believed to have originated from a mother snake bought from Japan, which was found to be pregnant only after arriving at Ocean Park in Wong Chuk Hang.</p><footer><a href=../../hku-study-identifies-virus-killed-31-baby-snakes-ocean-park.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../jennifer-aniston-reese-witherspoon-elle-awards.html>Silver goddess Jennifer Aniston shows off her sexiest dress yet</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

有些人會鬧得不開心，就是因為女生約會初期就「全都拿」，不管多貴的餐廳、多貴的禮物都照單全收，沒在客氣的，但最後又沒有要跟對方在一起，男生心有不甘就爆發糾紛了。妳覺得那是他追求女生的成本，沒追到怎麼能生氣？但他可能覺得，要是不給追，幹嘛害我花那麼多錢？

フェイスマッピングからわかること 目の下のクマは腎臓と密接な関係が
目の下のクマの種類とそれぞれの原因 目の下のクマを改善するには？ 規則正しい生活ですっきり目元にフェイスマッピングからわかること目元は皮膚が0.06㎜と薄く、肌は内臓を映す鏡といわれるように心身の状態が透けて見える。寝不足や疲労によって目の下が黒ずんだ経験から、心身と肌のつながりを誰もが感じているはず。今回ご紹介するフェイスマッピングは、そのつながりを解き明かすヒントになるといえるだろう。 足裏に反射区があるように、顔にも内臓に対応した反射区があり、海外では中医学やアーユルヴェーダの顔反射区に基づいた顔観察＝フェイスマッピングがしばしばクローズアップされている。肌トラブルを「体からの排泄」と捉え、老廃物が汗などと一緒に排出される時に、黒ずみやくすみに至ると考えるのだ。さあ、鏡を見てみよう。あなたの目元には何が現れ、何が排泄されようとしているのだろうか？
.
まず、目（眼球）は肝臓に対応していること、東洋医学でも目と肝臓は同じエレメントとして扱うことを理解しよう。そのため目の周りはすべて肝臓のゾーンと呼べなくもないほどで、周囲には肝臓と密接につながるゾーンが並んでいる。例えば目尻のシワや乾燥ジワが気になるエリアは、肝臓とタッグを組んで脂を消化する胆嚢のゾーン。
クマやアイバッグ（目袋）が悩ましい目の下は、肝臓と一緒に毒素を追い出そうとする腎臓の反射区が位置している。ただし目の下にクマがあるからといって「私は腎臓病なの？」と慌てないでほしい。腎臓は血液をきれいにするところ。目の下には血液の質や流れが影響しやすいのね、くらいに受け止めよう。
今回は目の下のクマについて解説。あなたの肌に何が起こっている？食事やスキンケアでどう対処したらいい？コスメ選びも含めて詳しくナビゲートしているので、鏡を見ながら確認してみて。
目の下のクマは腎臓と密接な関係が皮膚が薄い目の下は、腎臓の反射区だ。腎臓は尿を作り出すだけでなく、血液を濾過してきれいにするなど、血液の質に関わっているのをご存じだろうか？そして“肝腎要”というように、肝臓と腎臓は血液バランスの調整という大切な役目を果たしており、目の下に現れたクマやアイバッグ、肝斑やシミは血液の問題をアナウンスしている。

目の下のクマの種類とそれぞれの原因目の下のクマは原因によって現れ方も異なってくる。もっとも多くできやすい5つのクマの種類とそれぞれの原因をチェック。
1. 血行や鉄分不足が影響する赤クマさまざまなクマの中で比較的軽いのが赤クマ。ほんのり赤みがあるクマは寝不足や眼精疲労などによる血行の悪さが原因で、血行をよくするケアで回復する。ただし貧血の可能性もあるので鉄分が不足していないかチェックしてみよう。 2. 青クマは飲み過ぎや疲れているサイン？目の下の毛細血管が透けて見えることで生じる青クマ。一時的にできることが多く、飲み過ぎや強い疲労などにより血液内に老廃物が増えてスムーズに流れなくなっている状態。ひどくなると紫クマへと悪化してしまう。ゆっくり休養をとり、クマを定着させないように血流促進のためのアイケアを取り入れよう。
3. 青クマがひどくなると紫クマに精製された白砂糖や薬品、化学物質、アルコールの摂りすぎにより、解毒が追いついていない状況を物語っているのが紫クマ。東洋医学的にいえば、瘀血という血液が鬱滞した状態。血行をよくするケアに加え、ジュースクレンズなどのデトックスやピュアな水を飲むなどの対策を。 4. 加齢によるたるみが原因の黒クマ 一般的には黒クマは「影クマ」と説明され、目の下のたるみによる影が原因といわれる。目が大きなハッキリした顔立ちの人に目立ちやすい。ひどくなるとアイバックといわれる状態に。フェイスマッピングでは塩分の摂りすぎによって黒ずんだクマが現れるととらえている。
5. 色素沈着の可能性もある茶クマ目をこするなどの摩擦や紫外線による色素沈着によってできるクマで、日焼けしやすい人に生じやすい。肝斑なども絡んでいる可能性大。ゴルゴラインといわれる部分が茶色くなっている場合には、コーヒーやエナジードリンクなどのカフェインの摂りすぎの疑いも。 それらのほかにも、目の下は血流の滞りからターンオーバーも停滞し、ミリアという白いプツプツができやすい。これは汗腺や毛穴にケラチンタンパクが蓄積して閉じ込められた膿疱で、皮フの血流を良くすれば次第にできにくくなっていく。いよいよアイバッグが目立ってきたら、水分代謝が悪くなっているか、またはチーズなど乳製品の過剰摂取により血液のろ過がうまくいっていないことを疑う。 Rosdiana Ciaravolo//Getty Images
目の下のクマを改善するには？
上記のような原因を突き詰めることによって改善させる方法のほかに、日々のマッサージやメイクによるカモフラージュ、スペシャルケアを取り入れるのも一つの手だ。 マッサージするならここ！日々のケアにおすすめのツボフェイスマップから導き出した目の下のクマに効く顔ツボを、綿棒を使って押しほぐすマッサージ。下の写真を参考にして、眉頭から目頭の順番に、一カ所を軽く10回ほどたたいてみよう。目の下は皮膚が薄く跡がつきやすいので注意し、綿棒は先端がへたれてくると皮膚の負担となってしまうため、片目に1本ずつ使用して。
