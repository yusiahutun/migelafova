Soler competed in international baseball tournaments with the Cuban national team. He left Cuba in 2011 to pursue a career in Major League Baseball. Soler signed a nine-year contract with the Chicago Cubs after establishing his residency in Haiti. In 2014, he made his MLB debut. After the 2016 season, the Cubs traded Soler to the Kansas City Royals.</p><h3>Early life</h3><p>Jorge Carlos Soler Castillo (29 years old) was born in Havana, Cuba, on February 25, 1992. Jorge Soler Sr. is his father’s name while the name of his mother isn’t revealed. In 2016, Soler received his Ph.D. from the University Of Michigan School Of Public Health’s Department of Health Behavior and Health Education.</p><h3>Jorge Soler Career</h3><p>On June 11, 2012, Jorge allegedly signed to a nine-year, $30 million contract with the Chicago Cubs. Cubs general manager Jed Hoyer disputed reports that the Cubs had agreed to an agreement with Soler before he was declared a free agent. That same season, he made his professional debut with the AZL Cubs before being promoted to the Peoria Chiefs in August. Soler charged the opposition Clearwater Threshers’ dugout with a baseball bat on April 10, 2013, while playing for the Daytona Cubs, right following a bench-clearing incident. He was expelled from the game, fined, and suspended for five games. Soler spent the entire 2013 season with Daytona.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u9ec7c89734733885d29a92d169d79ba8><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Anavia Battle Biography</span></a><p>The Tennessee Smokies were Soler’s first team in 2014. Soler was promoted to the Iowa Cubs on July 22, 2014, after hitting.415/.494/.862 in 22 games with six home runs and 22 RBIs. On August 25, 2014, Jorge was called up to the Chicago Cubs for the first time. On August 27, facing Cincinnati Reds pitcher Mat Latos in his major league debut, Soler hit his first major league home run, becoming the 117th player in MLB history to do so.</p><h4>Rise to Fame</h4><p>Soler hit two doubles in his Cubs’ home debut on September 1, becoming only the third player in the last 100 years to have at least one extra-base hit in each of his first five games in the majors. Soler became the second player in Cubs history two days later. Jorge started the Cubs’ 2015 season in right field until an ankle ailment sidelined him in early June. Soler’s postseason debut came in 2015, when he walked as a pinch-hitter in the ninth inning of Game 1 of the Division Series, followed by a double, two-run home drive to straightaway centre, and two more walks in Game 2, then a home run, a single, and two more walks in Game 3.</p><p>The Cubs traded Soler to the Kansas City Royals for Wade Davis on December 7, 2016. Soler was relegated to the Omaha Storm Chasers on June 2 after a spate of injuries and inconsistency at the plate. Soler started the season as the Royals’ starting right fielder. He was forced to sit out the rest of the year after sustaining a toe fracture in mid-June. He hit.265 with nine home runs in 61 games. In 2019, Soler made his comeback from injury, splitting time between right field and designated hitter. In 2019, he batted.265 with 48 home runs and 178 strikeouts, leading the American League. His tally of home runs was the most by a Cuban-born player in a single season. Soler batted.228 with eight home runs and 24 RBIs in 43 games during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ue1e695ae52d4d92969a46e03dbe19ebb><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Jeff Lutz Biography</span></a><h4>Controversy</h4><p>Soler’s home run marked the first time the World Series began with a home run. In the first inning, four leadoff batters had homered, but it had never been done by a visiting team (i.e. the team that hits first). The line-drive home run traveled 382 feet after leaving Soler’s bat at 105 mph with a 22-degree launch angle. Valdez’s night didn’t get any better after that, as he went on to pitch two innings and give up five earned runs and eight hits.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Jorge Soler Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Jorge Carlos Soler Castillo</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>25 February 1992</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2021)</td><td>29 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Havana, Cuba</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Cuban</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Baseball Outfielder</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Pisces</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jorge-Soler-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 6’ 4” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 193 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 98 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 216 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>15 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Athletic</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Jorge Soler Sr.</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jorge-Soler-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Who is his wife?</td><td>Leydis Serrano</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Jorley, Leysa</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal life</h3><p>Jorge Soler is married to Leydis Serrano, his longtime girlfriend, and they married in a secret ceremony in Cuba in the 2000s.
