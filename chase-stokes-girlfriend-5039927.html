After all, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hollywood heartthrob</a> has played some charming characters including John B. on the hit Netflix show. Throughout his career in the public eye, Chase has also made headlines for his relationships with some other famous faces, including his&nbsp;Outer Banks co-star,&nbsp;<strong>Madelyn Cline</strong>, and country singer,&nbsp;<strong>Kelsea Ballerini</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Chase and Madelyn confirmed their relationship in June 2020, a few months after&nbsp;Outer Banks first hit streaming services and became a hit show. The two were together for more than a year before they split in the fall of 2021. Despite the breakup, though, they continued to work well together professionally, even filming the entire third season of&nbsp;Outer Banks following the split.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>While Chase’s love life was briefly kept out of the public eye after that breakup, he resurfaced the media at the beginning of 2023 due to his relationship with Kelsea. After weeks of speculation, Kelsea confirmed that the two were an item during a Feb. 2023 interview. They went on to make <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their red carpet debut</a> that April. Learn more about Chase’s romance history below:</p><h2>Chase Stokes & Kelsea Ballerini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chase-stokes-proud-to-be-singing-along-with-kelseas-cmt-performance-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Chase’s most recent leading lady is “Miss Me More” hitmaker, Kelsea Ballerini. The two were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first rumored</a> to be dating after being spotted at a football game together in 2023.The duo got cozy and were pictured snuggling up to each other while watching the game (see below). And just a couple of weeks later, on Jan. 26, they were spotted on a “flirty” date night in Nashville, TN,&nbsp; with photos showing them looking quite cozy as they spent time together in a bar. Chase and Kelsea later fueled romance rumors once more on Jan. 29, when they were spotted in a sweet embrace at LAX.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>It was then only a matter of time until the lovebirds themselves confirmed their relationship, respectively. First, the 30-year-old hunk confirmed he was dating the singer/songwriter while out and about on Jan. 17. When a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ&nbsp;</a>reporter called them the “cutest couple,” Chase responded with a kind, “Thank you.” Later, he did gush about the blonde beauty. “She’s a sweet girl and we’re having a good time. That’s all I’ll say,” he quipped.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>wait so kelsea and chase is a real thing?? <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/35J7yOnszy</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>— 𝖠𝗆𝗂𝗇𝖺❀ | kie’s og fan.🐢 (@glowstrcs) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>January 13, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Following Chase’s confirmation, Kelsea appeared on an episode of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Call Her Daddy</a>&nbsp;on Feb. 22, and detailed a bit about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her love life</a> with the up-and-coming actor. “I slid <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>into his DMs</a>,” the country singer shared. “I was just like…I’m not going to get on the apps. And he shoots [Outer Banks] in Charleston and my manager lives there. He put the bug in my ear. He’s like, ‘You know who’s really cute when you’re ready…’ and I’m like, ‘You’re so right!’ I’ve never seen the show but I knew of him. I followed him, he followed me and I swan dove right in.” Kelsea was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>newly divorced</a> from husband <strong>Morgan Evans</strong> when she began talking to Chase in Dec. 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Once the relationship was out there, Kelsea and Chase didn’t shy away from putting their love on display. They were both in New York City at the beginning of March for respective work obligations, with him in town to promote season 3 of&nbsp;Outer Banks and her there for an appearance on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live. While in the Big Apple, they made the most of their time together, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attending a New York Rangers game</a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>going on outings</a> in Manhattan. Chase was also backstage to support Kelsea for her&nbsp;SNL debut, and was subsequently seen watching her tour performances over the next several weeks.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>On April 2, 2023, Kelsea hosted the CMT Music Awards in Austin, Texas, and Chase was there as her date. The two walked the red carpet together for the first time at the event, officially solidifying that they are a couple. During a red carpet interview, Kelsea gushed that she had a “hot date” at the show, and when she took the stage to perform, Chase was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted rocking out and singing</a> along in the crowd.</p><h2>Chase Stokes & Madelyn Cline</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chase-Stokes-Madelyn-Cline-ev-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Before being loved up with Kelsea, Chase took his on-screen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>romance with&nbsp;Madelyn Cline</a> off-screen! In June 2020 Chase and the blonde bombshell took to Instagram to confirm their romance in since-deleted photos. “C<span>ats outta the bag,” he captioned the post, along with a heart emoji. Madelyn’s post was just as cute with a caption that read, “I’ve fallen and I can’t get up.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Fans believed their romance began long before they made it IG official, though, so it’s unclear exactly when these two officially got together. Chase and The Giant&nbsp;star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>parted ways</a> by Nov. 2021. A source close to Madelyn confirmed their split to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a> and called it her “single girl moment” at the time. Not only did they claim they had been “done for a while”, but the insider also added that Madelyn was, “just kind of living her single girl moment.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Most recently, on Feb. 3, 2023, the Netflix duo chatted with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Weekly</a>&nbsp;about working together following their romantic falling out. “Mads and I have been working together now for 30 episodes, and we made a promise to each other before we even started dating that the work was always going to come first,” Chase shared with the outlet. “And that no matter what happens in our personal lives, and the ways that life sometimes takes you in different directions, that we’re always going to honor the work. That stayed 100 percent truthful this season.” And in agreement, Madelyn noted, “We had a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>working relationship</a> before we had a personal relationship, and our job from day one has always been to leave the show better than we found it.”</p><h2>His Brief Encounter With Izzy Metz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/chase-stokes-izzy-metz-backgrid-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-17>Soon after Chase’s public romance with Madelyn, he was spotted on an outing with model <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Izzy Metz</strong></a>, 22. A source spotted the two out at a party in New York City in July 2022 and detailed the encounter to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a>. “Chase and Izzy went to a party at The Box together. They were seen arriving and exiting together, and then they went to Marquee and left there together as well,” the insider claimed at the time. In addition, the outlet’s source alleged that Izzy and Chase were very “flirty” throughout the evening. ”They were really flirty — hugging and holding hands,” they addded. “They were snuggling and canoodling in the car. They were definitely trying to be low-key.” And despite being photographed leaving the venue together (see above), not more came of this brief romance.</p><h2>Chase & Xiomara Montalvo</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>Finally, before Chase dated the above mentioned ladies, his heart was taken for nearly a decade by a non-celebrity woman named&nbsp;<strong>Xiomara Montalvo</strong>. Although not much is publicly known about their longtime love, Chase did open up about the split, without naming her, during an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Strategist</a>&nbsp;in May 2020. “I went through a breakup a little bit before quarantine, and it was with somebody I’d been with for almost 10 years,” he said at the time. “I’ve been writing about it, drawing inspiration from the isolation of quarantine — there’s a similar kind of heartbreak involved.” Although Xiomara is not as famous as her now-ex, she does have over 3K followers on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> where she frequently shares stunning <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bikini snapshots</a> (see above).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8KhmKydXajBsLfErGSgoaKhs7O1xKebZm1gaIZ6fpZo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchase-stokes-girlfriend-5039927.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchase-stokes-girlfriend-5039927.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchase-stokes-girlfriend-5039927.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchase-stokes-girlfriend-5039927.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchase-stokes-girlfriend-5039927.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchase-stokes-girlfriend-5039927.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-scalp-massagers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-scalp-massagers.html>Best Scalp Massagers for Women Over 40</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./succession-star-alan-ruck-sued-pizza-shop-truck-crash.html>'Succession' Star Alan Ruck Sued for Pizza Shop Truck Crash</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./succession-star-alan-ruck-sued-pizza-shop-truck-crash.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
