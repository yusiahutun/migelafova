From mountainous walks to cocktails on the beach, it's safe to say Scarlette has had the trip of a lifetime.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I stayed at the five-star Grand Hyatt Berlin - and here are my thoughts" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1b49e4a74f57-berghp1257clubolympuspool.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I stayed at the five-star Grand Hyatt Berlin - and here are my thoughts" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I stayed at the five-star Grand Hyatt Berlin - and here are my thoughts</a></h5></li></ul><p id=epM3iKGwi9 data-wc=55>The TV star, who is most famous for hosting Channel 4's <a class=hm-link href=#>A Place in the Sun</a>, was inspired to travel to the island partly due to her Caribbean heritage, but also thanks to her time on the show which saw her meet with prospective house buyers looking to relocate to Aruba.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3C5m0W0ce data-wc=35>"Aruba has a rich and interesting history and, like most of the Caribbean, is a diverse collection of people and cultures," Scarlette tells <strong></strong> as she gives us an exclusive look inside her remarkable trip.&nbsp;</p><h2>What surprised you most - and what was the best thing about Aruba?</h2><p id=e1NiZnfWDK data-wc=40>I was most surprised by the fact that it's a desert island, not a tropical one. Whilst it has the sunshine and beaches that you find in most Caribbean islands, inland the landscape is unlike most of the other islands.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3efffa69b229-03-scarlette-douglas-.jpg><p id=ebvom6OIN0 data-wc=43>Arid, rugged and mountainous, it offers the opportunity to explore various terrains and participate in activities that you probably wouldn't be able to in your typical beach idyll. The views are incredible, the people are warm and welcoming and the cuisine is delicious.</p><h2>What can you tell us about the food and culture?</h2><p id=eZmTB0CQOr data-wc=42>The food is very good. Historically, Aruba was owned by the Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch and with its close proximity to South America, all of the culinary flavours and influences from each of these places have organically melded into the Aruban cuisine.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Scarlette Douglas' top Aruba restaurants</h3><p id=eFpDFCBfbw><strong>Caya</strong></p><p id=ePJFeSqPCk></p><p id=e82M3VbbTK>The cocktails here were the real star of the show and my favourite was the Margarita Caliente - fruity and smoky with kicks of different heat from the ginger turmeric syrup and shots of tequila and mezcal. The Salty Caramel Crunch for dessert was like a refined Snickers supercharged with Vibranium!&nbsp;</p><p id=e4ium-KrhL><strong>Taste My Aruba</strong></p><p id=eUUBWUAkBI></p><p id=e39M6SQOLW>The ceviche was vibrant, fresh and zesty. The combination of Amberjack and Red Snapper, both their own distinct flavour and texture, complimented each other to make this dish the perfect amuse-bouche for the hearty main courses. Good selection of cocktails and wines too.&nbsp;</p><p id=elDJlXzqU3><strong>West Deck</strong></p><p id=eEzFSYEhsS></p><p id=eUYWsN5UOT>A relaxed restaurant on the beach that serves rustic food and has views across the sea. The menu is vast, which for some could be overwhelming, for me it offered the choice and catered for whatever mood we were in and we were in the mood to eat! The local grouper fingers were melt-in-the-mouth good - encased in a crisp, light batter that kept the fish hot and succulent. The shrimp and ribs were also so good. The unsung hero here though are definitely the Tater Tots - if you don’t see them on the menu, please ask! Like a mini, crunchy hash brown, deep fried and delicious.</p><p id=elgcQ-sh__ data-wc=45>Aruba seems to have taken the best of all of those nations' influences to offer some culinary delights. The people are welcoming and like to party. The carnival celebrations run over three months, peaking in February, which I think reflects the spirit of the community.</p><h2>What did the trip mean to you?</h2><p id=e83oyyl3dS data-wc=45>This trip is different from before, much more special because this time I'm going in the capacity of UK Ambassador to Aruba. I am now able to endorse its beauty and uniqueness in ways that I was previously unable to due to professional working restrictions.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7587378d5966-scarlette-douglas.jpg><h2>What does a day in the life on holiday look like for you?</h2><p id=eLMiLHGGJ9 data-wc=60>It always starts with breakfast! It's the most important meal of the day as I never know where the day will take me, so ensuring I eat to have the energy to face anything is vital. I'll then head out to explore the area I'm in. I never really relax, I prefer being out and about and finding new things.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Inside Scarlette Douglas sun-soaked vacation in Aruba</figure><p id=eCUFrDjyPAt data-wc=60>You've probably realised that I love food - so will make sure that if I'm too busy to get lunch, I'll always end the day with a good meal for dinner. This could be a cheap local street food vendor or a high-end, exclusive restaurant - I really don't mind as long as the food is fresh and tastes amazing.&nbsp;</p><h2>What kind of holidayer are you - sunbathe all day or go-go-go?</h2><p id=emSk-GziYu data-wc=35>I am, without a doubt, go-go-go. I never really stop to lounge and sunbathe on holiday as I love to explore too much. There's always so much to see away from the standard tourist attractions.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/04b9e6178262-scarlette-douglas-eagle-beach.jpg><p id=e6yYa1unwD9 data-wc=33>One of my favourite things about being away is getting almost lost and finding wonderful new places that aren't in any guidebooks or online reviews, I've found some real gems on my travels.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tell us about your time on A Place in the Sun… Did you need a break from the show?</h2><p id=egjvyvKd2T data-wc=81>That's partly the reason I no longer present A Place in The Sun. I was in a privileged position where I was paid to travel the world, visiting some amazing places and meeting genuinely good people, but whilst the benefits were plentiful, I think everything we do in life naturally runs its course. Though I'm grateful for the period I had doing it, I wanted to use the experience gained and skills learnt to try new things and challenge myself more.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e4a04611afd1-scarlette-douglas-paddleboard.jpg><h2>How did the show inspire you to broaden your horizons?</h2><p id=e7KJIqTh05 data-wc=36>When I worked on and with my own show, , I was temporarily immersed in the authentic traditions and lifestyles of the places I visited.&nbsp;</p><p id=e4qWR0-9kxK data-wc=70>Interacting with people who had researched and frequented the areas, along with the knowledge passed on by local residents, merchants and estate agents, enabled me to go to places that were not on the usual tourist lists, or perhaps deemed 'unsafe'. This allowed me to experience places that people ordinarily wouldn't go to. Some of these places proved to be the best I saw and gave me the richest experiences.&nbsp;</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Scarlette Douglas' holiday packing essentials</h3><ul><li><strong>Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream and Face Wash</strong></li><li><strong>Charlotte Tilbury Instant Magic Facial Dry Sheet face mask</strong></li><li><strong>Absolute Joi SPF 40 Mineral sunscreen Female Dignity </strong>- LOVE 100% natural sanitary products</li><li><strong>RayBan Aviator Sunglasses</strong> - They're a classic style, whilst also durable and protective.

This doesn't have to mean a trip abroad or far from home, but taking time to switch off, rest and recuperate can improve our overall wellbeing.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3U2seo65H data-wc=48>At the end of 2021, I felt burnt out - physically and emotionally exhausted. It made me realise that I need to pause once in a while. I understand that if I don't slow down sometimes, I'm a lot less productive and lose a bit of my shine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aa11490705b2-07-scarlette-douglas-taste-my-aruba-ceviche.jpg><p id=eGnRYQLrCG data-wc=39>I also have Vitamin D deficiency, so sunshine is a must for me. It invigorates me and makes me feel happier within myself. Aruba is sunny pretty much all year round so whenever you go, you're almost guaranteed sunshine.&nbsp;</p><h2>Finally, would you like to return to Aruba?</h2><p id=eyfTNB1q8F data-wc=56>Absolutely! Hopefully, my work with The Aruba Tourism Authority and the direct British Airways flight from London to Aruba will mean that can visit many more times. I'd love to buy a holiday home here, so I can introduce the island to my friends and family so we can all be happy in the sun together!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfqb%2BiwsSlZm5oZWV%2FcnvSnJirpJWpwaZ5w6isoKSRqHqivtSbmGaZlKuyr8DUq5xmnaiYuba%2FyK%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fscarlette-douglas-aruba-adventure-exclusive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fscarlette-douglas-aruba-adventure-exclusive.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fscarlette-douglas-aruba-adventure-exclusive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fscarlette-douglas-aruba-adventure-exclusive.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fscarlette-douglas-aruba-adventure-exclusive.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fscarlette-douglas-aruba-adventure-exclusive.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./foy-vance-songs.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./foy-vance-songs.html>6 Places You've Heard or Seen Foy Vance Before</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./former-bodyguard-on-the-biggest-threats-to-the-royal-family-and-how-theyre-prevented.html>Former bodyguard on the biggest threats to the royal family and how they're prevented</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./former-bodyguard-on-the-biggest-threats-to-the-royal-family-and-how-theyre-prevented.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
