The contestants have to navigate their way through a myriad of different challenges and juggle their romantic equations along the way.&nbsp;Participants in the show are stranded on an island that is barely an hour from the bustling crowds of Seoul. The show goes back and forth between Single’s Inferno which is a deserted island and Paradise which is another island flooded with all sorts of luxuries.

Female contestants locate themselves in different corners of Single’s Inferno and the male contestants are then supposed to approach them. The male contestant extends a proposal to the female contestant of his choice.

The conclusion of the trip brings the viewers to the most interesting part of the show. People can enter the show with whoever they want but who they bid their farewell to is something that the viewers want to know.

While some contestants explore the romantic opportunities that are in front of them, some look at a concluded equation in a new light. As the show progresses, you find couples pondering the infamous ‘should I stay or should I go’ dilemma. The show is titled ‘EXchange’ which itself is a wordplay on changing or interchanging equations of romance. Ex-partners reunite under one roof alongside other similar broken-up couples. These reunited couples then navigate their way through concluded equations and budding ones. When the show begins, ex-couples treat each other like complete strangers. If someone tries to make a move on someone new, their ex jumps in and tries their best to make things awkward.&nbsp;There are situations when one person has let go of the past and their ex has not. Such situations add to the absolute awkward chaos that a broken-up couple can be subjected to. The show approached dating shows in a completely different manner. Viewers already had a hard time whenever two strangers they shipped did not end up together on a dating show. ‘Transit Love’ added the touch of a complicated romantic past to that misery and made things even more dramatic. As the end approaches, the couples are supposed to make a choice between what has apparently been left behind and what is in front of them. The finale to ‘Transit Love’ is exponentially more thrilling because here people aren’t just rooting for two complete strangers to get together, here, their expectations are getting fueled by unawareness of the contestant’s past.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2 id=6579c38d5deae><strong>4 | Love Catcher</strong></h2><br><ul><li><strong>Cast: </strong>Shin Dong Yup, Hong Seok Cheon, Lady Jane</li><li><strong>Genre: </strong>Dating, Variety, Love Triangle</li><li><strong>OTT Platform: </strong>Netflix, Apple TV</li></ul><p><strong>‘</strong>Love Catcher’ is a 2018 release that follows a group of people who go all out to get what they want.

Amongst their other co-residents, the participants on the show are supposed to find the right one. While the premise sounds quite easy to navigate through, the game has a few rules that might come in the way of expressing one’s self ‘directly’. The part of the week where participants had to finalise their romantic decisions was most anticipated by viewers and kept them hooked throughout the show’s run. People simply loved making predictions around the romantic equations of the cast. A fun spin off to Heart Signal was released in 2021. It was called ‘Friends’. It followed the cast in a more humane way as they were seen traversing through friendship and love. The show follows the residents of the Signal House as they embark on their journey to find the one they like. There is however one thing that will make it hard for them to approach the one they like - they cannot be direct about their affections. Everything that reaches their object of affection has to be done via a ‘signal’. As they try to accomplish the latter, they are constantly being monitored by a panel of judges. The judges make sure that no rules are broken and also have surveillance over the romantic potential of different infant equations in the Signal House. As the residents of Signal House struggle to express themselves and find the right one, the judges significantly contribute to the final decision of who ends up with whom.&nbsp;While the judges prevent any conspicuous communication, the couples manage to constantly find a way to express themselves. The equations that manage to bloom despite the rules and the surveillance are the ones that make it to the finale.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>11 | Love and Joy</strong></h2><br><ul><li><strong>Year of Release: </strong>2021</li><li><strong>Cast:</strong> Son Min Soo, Im La Ra</li><li><strong>Genre: </strong>Dating, Reality, Friendship</li><li><strong>OTT Platform: </strong>Peacock</li></ul><p><strong>‘</strong>Love and Joy’ is a 2021 South <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Singles Inferno to Change Days: 11 Korean dating shows to watch RN","1211540","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/netflixs-hit-dating-reality-show-singles-inferno-announces-recruitment-for-third-season-1211980","articlepage","/entertainment/singles-inferno-to-change-days-11-korean-dating-shows-to-watch-rn-1211540","Korean dating show","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>Korean dating show</a>.
