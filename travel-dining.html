As Harper’s Bazaar editors, we’re constantly on the go, whether for cover shoots, work events, Fashion Month—or vacations from cover shoots and work events and Fashion Month. And we’ve kept tabs on our favorite discoveries and recommendations. So we’ve rounded up our favorite properties from across the globe: the ones that have become a home away from home, the ones we consider our happy places, and the ones we dream of going back to as soon as we touch down back in the city. Think transcendent properties, luxury spas, private pools, Michelin-starred restaurants, and unique local experiences. These are just some of the places where we’ve made the kinds of memories that last long after your vacation is over—and where we hope you’ll make those memories too.</p><h2 class="css-hnxgmj emt9r7s5">Jump to:</h2><ul class="css-13kv1hr emt9r7s4"><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Alajuela, Costa Rica</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Amsterdam</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Como, Italy</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Cusco, Peru</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Kyoto, Japan</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">London</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Los Angeles</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Marrakech, Morocco</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Mykonos, Greece</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Naples, Italy</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Negril, Jamaica</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Newmarket-on-Fergus, Ireland</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">New Orleans</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">New York City</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Park City, Utah</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Paris</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Ravello, Italy</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Rome</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Sedona, Arizona</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Udaipur, India</a></li><li class="css-fjhdb4 emt9r7s3"><a href=# data-update-hash=true data-dispatch-ga=true class="emt9r7s2 css-1ohjnhk e1c1bym14">Washington, D.C.</a></li></ul><h2 data-node-id title="Alajuela, Costa Rica" data-anchor-id=alajuela-costa-rica class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Alajuela, Costa Rica<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h2><img alt="a train going through a forest" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1-family-tent-662664da7b865.jpg title="a train going through a forest" width=4000 height=2250 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 id="[pullquote-align='center']Amsterdam,-Netherlands[/pullquote]" data-node-id=5 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Nayara Springs</h2><p id="[pullquote-align='center']Amsterdam,-Netherlands[/pullquote]" data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’m not a nature girl, but I am married to a nature boy. He’s never been able to convince me to go camping, but Nayara Tented Camp, a luxury retreat in the middle of the Costa Rican jungle and at the base of the dramatic Arenal Volcano, was an easy sell for both of us—and especially our then five-year-old. The accommodations are luxe tents with giant outdoor showers and private pools heated by natural hot springs. It’s not easy to achieve a vacation that has something for everyone, especially a little kid, but there were so many things for us all to do that were seamlessly arranged by the staff: yoga, cooking classes where I learned to make ceviche, hikes, a sloth sanctuary, and nighttime “frog walks” where a knowledgeable tour guide pointed out the surrounding wildlife. (My husband was psyched when one of the animals we stumbled upon was not a frog, but a black mamba, which our guide told us was “one of the deadliest snakes in the world.” Don’t worry—they can’t get into the tents.) My kid was completely enchanted, and the staff added thoughtful details just for him, like a little robe and slippers that made him feel really special. I could see the core memories forming. —Leah Chernikoff, executive editor</p><h2 data-node-id title=Amsterdam data-anchor-id=amsterdam class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Amsterdam<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h2><img alt="a group of buildings next to a body of water" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/exterior-6-660b100370d93.jpg title="a group of buildings next to a body of water" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Pulitzer Amsterdam</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Recently, a friend texted our group chat to ask for recommendations on where to stay in Amsterdam, and I practically broke my thumbs in my rush to text her back. Several years ago, I stayed at the Pulitzer and have been dreaming about its many unique charms ever since.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The hotel is built within 25 renovated canal houses that date back to the Dutch Golden Age, in the 1600s. The property is laid out to weave through the houses, so no two rooms are the same; preserved architectural features speak to each room’s history. There are original wood beams, plaster moulding, marble staircases, ornate fireplaces—quirk and character around every corner. On one side, more opulent rooms once belonging to the 17th-century elite overlook the Keizersgracht canal; on the other, more eclectic rooms overlook the Prinsengracht. In between are picturesque gardens, a bustling restaurant, and one of the best bars in the city, all decked out in a combination of modern and traditional design flourishes. (Think Dutch masters next to contemporary neon sculptures.) And if that’s not enough local flair for you, the Pulitzer is perfectly situated in the scenic heart of the city, where boutiques and cafés abound and museums are steps (or a short bike ride) away. So there will be as many discoveries to make outside the hotel as inside it. —Nojan Aminosharei, special projects editor</p><h2 data-node-id title="Como, Italy" data-anchor-id=como-italy class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Como, Italy<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h2><img alt="a dining room with a large window" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/grand-hotel-tremezzo-t-bar-ruben-0g5a6476-66267260e8edc.jpg title="a dining room with a large window" width=1280 height=1920 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Grand Hotel Tremezzo</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I went to the Grand Hotel Tremezzo years ago, on the heels of Paris Fashion Week and after the birth of my first kid, and it was immediately transporting. There isn’t a corner of the place that isn’t sumptuously styled as if Wes Anderson and Slim Aarons had opened a luxury outpost on the banks of Lake Como. And every detail of your stay is just as impeccably curated as the decor and landscaping: the decadent room service, the pool that floats atop the lake, the cigar boats that zip you around on tour. The hotel’s glass elevator treats you to 360-degree views of the property, so not even the short trip to your room is without visual delights. —LC</p><h2 data-node-id title="Cusco, Peru" data-anchor-id=cusco-peru class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Cusco, Peru<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h2><img alt="best hotels in the world" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mon-ext-66-6603273356a6d.jpg title="best hotels in the world" width=1280 height=1920 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Belmond Hotel Monasterio</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I don’t know if it was the high elevation of Cusco (it’s the ninth-highest-elevated city in the world) or the sheer beauty of this converted monastery, but my breath was taken away when I first stepped onto the grounds of the Belmond Hotel Monasterio. It’s a good thing some of the rooms can be enriched with extra oxygen to alleviate the affects of the altitude. Despite such modern luxuries, the 16th-century Spanish architecture has preserved the property’s Old World beauty, and all its rooms surround an impeccably manicured courtyard that is perfect for sipping on a coca leaf tea and stargazing. And when you want to venture out, the Belmond group can make sure you do it with style: It also operates the Hiram Bingham luxury train, which you can take to the base of Machu Picchu. —Miguel Enamorado, accessories director</p><h2 data-node-id title="Kyoto, Japan" data-anchor-id=kyoto-japan class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Kyoto, Japan<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h2><img alt="a room with a bed and a window with trees outside" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hoshinoya-kyoto-guest-room-4-660b0d6b13e30.jpg title="a room with a bed and a window with trees outside" width=3714 height=2783 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Hoshinoya Kyoto</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s an internet cliché to declare that your skin is clear, your grades are up, your depression is cured, or any number of hyperboles in response to something you approve of. But dear reader, when I tell you that a hotel cured my fear of needles, I mean it. I once blacked out watching Scarlett Johansson get her ear pierced in Girl With a Pearl Earring (true story). Now if I’m getting a vaccine jab or a blood draw, all my anxieties melt away when I just close my eyes and think of my happy place: Hoshinoya Kyoto.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are Hoshinoya resorts throughout Japan (the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://hoshinoresorts.com/en/hotels/hoshinoyatokyo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tokyo outpost" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Tokyo outpost</a> is another of my all-time favorite hotels) and other parts of Asia (an outpost recently opened in Bali), but the Kyoto location is truly an unparalleled retreat. Perched on a hillside off of the Ōi River (also known as the Katsura River), the hotel is accessed by boat. Visitors are picked up at the Togetsu-kyo Bridge in the tourist center of the city and ferried up the winding jade waters to a dock on the banks of Arashiyama. Immediately, you're transported to a tranquil refuge that seems almost plucked out of time: The hotel operates similarly to a traditional ryokan, and in fact some of the grounds use the architecture of an inn that catered to nobility more than 100 years ago. There’s a “water garden” where live music in the Buddhist tradition is played against the sound of waterscapes; a “floating tearoom” set on a canopy overlooking the river; a world-class restaurant; and a rotating slate of activities, from lessons in kado (the art of flower arranging) to Zen meditation to seasonal explorations of the area’s natural wonders. Hoshinoya Kyoto sits at the cross section of tradition splendor and modern luxury, and I’m ready to book my next trip. Maybe after that, I can finally get my ears pierced. —NA</p><h2 data-node-id title=London data-anchor-id=london class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>London<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h2><img alt="one hundred shoreditch london" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-one-hundred-room-at-one-hundred-shoreditch-1-6603001d621b2.jpg title="one hundred shoreditch london" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">One Hundred Shoreditch London</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My first experience of London was when I traveled abroad and lived in Notting Hill. As the rom-com named for the neighborhood would suggest, it’s a mix of artsy and posh, with a lot of bohemian bookstores and street fairs, as well as pastel houses with the kinds of private gardens you picture when you imagine where Stella McCartney relaxes on her Sundays off. It was lovely, but I’d find myself jonesing for the grittier parts of New York City that I frequent in my day-to-day, like the Lower East Side and areas of Brooklyn. That’s why I ended up spending most of my time visiting the vintage shopping spots and cool cafés of East London.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So when I was back in London for Fashion Week recently, I decided to stay at the recently opened One Hundred Shoreditch, which I quickly decided would now be my go-to every time I’m there. It’s in the coolest area of East London, near incredible shops, vintage markets, and casual eateries that all just felt unquestionably hip. I’m a strict itinerary traveller, but even I can’t deny the lure of just stepping out of the hotel and walking around to wherever the streets took me.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And if I was tired after long day of shows and appointments, I could stay in and order some of the most delicious room service. Even better, One Hundred Shoreditch has its own dedicated app, so I could order room service from a few stops away on the tube and arrive in time for it to be delivered to my room. Now that’s true luxury! —Tara Gonzalez, senior fashion editor</p><h2 data-node-id title="Los Angeles" data-anchor-id=los-angeles class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Los Angeles<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h2><img alt="hotel bel air best hotels" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2023-07-hba-exteriors-0026-v1-hr-660c26d431e05.jpg title="hotel bel air best hotels" width=1920 height=1440 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Hotel Bel-Air</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nestled among the winding roads of the Los Angeles neighborhood that gave the hotel its name, this local institution has long been one of the city’s most elegant hotels. As a little girl, I dreamed of getting married on the grassy lawn next to Swan Lake, where—you guessed it—real live swans would glide around their very own slice of heaven.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because of the hotel’s location off the beaten path, just north of Sunset, guests are met with quiet serenity upon arrival. (It’s why the hotel caters to so many of the ultra-famous. I once saw Whitney Houston there in an airbrushed T-shirt that read “Whitney,” as if she’d been at some teenager named Whitney’s bat mitzvah the night before and not wearing a shirt emblazoned with her own household name.) Once you leave the world behind at valet parking and cross the iconic bridge to the hotel entrance, you quickly realize there’s no reason to leave the property during your stay. Swim at the pool, soak in one of the spa’s tubs, peruse the sculpture garden, dine in at the restaurant, then grab a nightcap at the bar and lounge. It’s all in a perfect day. —Andrea Cuttler, entertainment director</p><img alt=" " src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pwh2-rest-bar-pendry-03-1289-1-1-6602fd01c9540.jpeg title=" " width=3000 height=1784 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 data-node-id=37 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Pendry West Hollywood</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like any New Yorker (though many of us won’t admit it), I’ve let myself fantasize about what life would be like in Los Angeles. Staying at the Pendry West Hollywood seemed to capture the best of what I imagine: peaceful days full of sun by the pool and late-night industry fetes. There’s not a bad room at the property, which has 149 of them, all boasting gorgeous views overlooking the Hollywood Hills. The view lived up to my fantasies so much so that one evening, cuddled up in an embroidered French terry-cloth robe and sipping an oat milk latte, I began considering the Cali life full time. —Bianca Betancourt, culture editor</p><h2 data-node-id title="Marrakech, Morocco" data-anchor-id=marrakech-morocco class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Marrakech, Morocco<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h2><img alt="a pool surrounded by trees" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rooftop-110923-311448-660c4fb0eaf41.jpg title="a pool surrounded by trees" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 data-node-id=41 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">La Mamounia Marrakesh<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This historic hotel in Marrakesh has hosted A-listers from Charlie Chaplin to Paul McCartney, and for good reason. The lavish Moroccan resort is a destination in itself, with ornate architecture that rivals a royal palace and gorgeous landscaping you can get lost in. (Imagine starting every morning with a walk through lush lavender fields.) But it’s the attentive and personalized service that has made the hotel the bastion of hospitality that it is. Upon arrival, you’re offered homemade almond milk and local dates. (I never thought I’d describe dried fruit as life-changing, but I am and the dates are.) Throughout the day, employees roam with cold drinks and tasty Moroccan dishes.

It’s a country I constantly find myself going back to, and its culture—the architecture, the food, the lifestyle—is a source of inspiration. On a girls’ trip a few years ago, I stayed at the incredible Mykonian Villa Collection, in a villa with a private pool overlooking the Aegean Sea. I will never get over that view, which I would say is the best on the island, courtesy of the resort’s place atop a hillside in Elia Bay. It literally rises above the noise below.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Everything about the hotel is luxurious and yet somehow homey. I practically forgot there was I time when I wasn’t spending my lunch eating a fresh salad doused in local olive oil and huge chunks of feta while lounging at a beach club. (For dinners, I had amazing Greek wine and fish at Cabbanes, at the hotel, and superb sushi at Sishu, located at its sister resort, Imperial, on the same grounds.) And if you enjoy a good Myko party like me, the hotel’s shuttles are will take you down to the island’s center and bring you back up once you’re done barhopping. —Rosa Sanchez, senior news editor</p><h2 data-node-id title="Naples, Italy" data-anchor-id=naples-italy class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Naples, Italy<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h2><img alt="best hotels bazaar" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mezzatorre-hotel-thermal-spa-airview-2-jpg-660b129196dfc.jpg title="best hotels bazaar" width=1920 height=1439 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 data-node-id=51 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Mezzatorre Hotel</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Arriving by boat to a private hotel dock on an Italian island already feels like something out of a movie—but the effect is even more cinematic as you pass the catamaran from The Talented Mr. Ripley, which the Mezzatorre owns, on your way. The majestic palazzo is perched on a rocky hill on the island of Ischia, just off from the mainland of Naples, and once you arrive, you won’t want to leave.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And you won’t need to! The hotel houses a thermal spas with a seawater pool and Turkish baths, alfresco restaurants (try the lobster pasta), a chic seaside pool, and a lower deck that sits atop the hotel’s private rock beach, where you can dip into cool, salty waters of the Mediterranean. And there’s a cool store curated by the property’s hotelier, Marie-Louise Sciò, which sells items from the in-house Issimo brand and other stylish wares.

The hotel is tucked away on the west end of the island, where volcanic cliffs meet the glassy Caribbean Sea. (The area is aptly called Pristine Cove.) The grounds, which include a tranquil spa and festive restaurants, conform to the natural landscape, and tropical gardens fill out every pass. Even the buildings are made from local stone and timber, with the furniture constructed on-site at the hotel's in-house woodworking studio. Stay in the thatched-roof villas (preserved and renovated from the hotel’s original opening in the 1970s) if you want to feel nestled in greenery. Or opt for the ocean-view suites with spacious balconies if you want to see endless sunsets over the water.

With luxe tapestries, ornate stone turrets, four-post canopy beds, and high tea? Well, staying at Dromoland is exactly like that—but with fantastic modern cuisine, golf (if that’s your thing, and it does seem to be many guests’ thing), and falconry. There’s nothing more thrilling than a falcon swooping down to land on your gloved hand against a backdrop of a castle surrounded by lush Irish greenery. I highly recommend it! And I’ve never encountered a nicer, warmer staff. But what did I expect? They’ve been welcoming guests on the estate since the 1500s. They’ve got practice. My friend and I got lost hiking, and they tracked us down and picked us up God-knows-where in the countryside.

So I decided to start doing short staycations for special occasions—birthdays, anniversaries, the end of particularly long workweeks, the rare 60-degree day in the middle of January—and I always include at least one stay a year at the Beekman.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=73 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Beekman is one of those rare places with impeccable and very real New York vibes; it has the kind of history you just can’t fake. In another life, the building and its nine-story atrium were called Temple Court—better known as New York’s first “skyscraper,” built in 1883 (the same year as the Brooklyn Bridge). As an homage, the hotel’s restaurant is now named Temple Court too. I particularly love to spend hours at the restaurant’s Bar Room, one of the best spots in the city to people-watch.

Though I’m decidedly neither of these things, when I lived in the city before moving to L.A. it became my go-to for, well, practically anything. Pre-dinner drinks with friends, post-dinner drinks with friends, drinks and dinner with friends—basically anything that involved drinks with friends, whether locals or out-of-towners. (I would tell everyone to stay there when coming to the city.) The Lobby Bar—adorned with velvet couches, vintage lamps, deep wood tones, and a cozy fireplace—always made it seem as though I was kibitzing in the comfort of my very own Old World boho home. Mario, Rey Rey, and Pidyan, the hotel’s longtime staffers, became friends.

Built in 1884, the building now known as the Hotel Chelsea has seen many iterations—most notably in the 1960s, when it hosted an eclectic crowd, including authors, artists, regulars from Andy Warhol’s Factory, and rock stars like Patti Smith and Bob Dylan, who wrote parts of the classic album Blonde on Blonde while he was a resident at what was then the Chelsea Hotel. I’d spent so much of my life reading and fantasizing about what it was like that when I heard the hotel would reopen in the summer of 2022, I nearly passed out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=81 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’ve since spent many nights there, and it still feels like a portal to another time, a piece of living New York history. I could spend hours poring over the interior design of all 155 updated rooms (and those of the permanent residents). Every detail is filled with the kind of eccentric personality that makes this city feel like the center of the world. Not to mention that the hotel's Cafe Chelsea, Lobby Bar, and El Quijote serve some of my favorite martinis in the entire city. And yes, the ravioli sheet and Lobby Bar martini, served with a side of champagne, really do live up to the hype. —TG</p><img alt="the standard new york" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/17011-press-standard-210-17-062-660c5c2e400b1.jpg title="the standard new york" width=6300 height=4200 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 data-node-id=83 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The Standard High Line<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=84 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After the Standard High Line opened in 2009, it quickly became one of the city’s nightlife centers, playing host to countless Fashion Week parties, premiere events, and good old-fashioned see-and-be-seen nights out at its top-floor haunts the Boom Boom Room and Le Bain. Now, 15 years later, the place is still a vibe.

While neighboring areas of the coast like Positano and Amalfi offer bustling bars and trattorias, Ravello and Palazzo Avino (also affectionately called “The Pink Palace” by staff and locals) is a getaway meant for relaxation. It’s the perfect for couples (especially, say, those rebounding from wedding planning) looking to tune out all the noise and just be together. For those who want to lay out and soak up the southern Italian sun, sipping an Amalfi spritz on the property’s signature pink-striped beach beds is a perfect way to spend your vacation.

For those looking for the ultimate intimate experience, request the property’s Infinity Suite—a room equipped with a private roof deck, jacuzzi, and sun loft. It’s the kind of getaway that will make you want to get right back and soon as you return home. —BB</p><h2 data-node-id title=Rome data-anchor-id=rome class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Rome<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h2><img alt="a building with tables and chairs in front of it" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nh-collection-roma-fori-imperiali-4-66265e3390a08.jpg title="a building with tables and chairs in front of it" width=3500 height=2336 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 data-node-id=100 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Roma Fori Imperiali</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=101 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For my birthday last summer, I took myself on a trip to Rome. It was my first time in Italy, and I wanted to make sure I stayed in a central location that provided easy access to all the sights without feeling like a tourist trap. The NH Collection Roma Fori Imperiali fit the bill perfectly: Outside, the Colosseum and Roman Forum were just down the street, and the Trevi Fountain was only a 10-minute walk away; inside, my room overlooked the Vittoriano, and included an oversize soaking tub and luxuriously comfortable bed that felt as soft as a cloud after a long day of sightseeing. The hotel's 24-hour concierge was only a text message away, and they were ready to handle any requests that newbies like me would have. (They even handled all my dinner reservations.) If it’s your first Roman holiday, this is the place. —Jennifer Algoo, visual director</p><h2 data-node-id title="Sedona, Arizona" data-anchor-id=sedona-arizona class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Sedona, Arizona<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h2><img alt="enchantment resort sedona" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/106-king-pull-down-casita-suite-1-6603070b7af57.jpg title="enchantment resort sedona" width=2000 height=1333 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 data-node-id=104 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Enchantment Resort Sedona</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=105 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A certain magic keeps me coming back to Sedona, Arizona.

The hotel offers outdoor enthusiasts hikes and morning meditations. (If you have a day to spare, the Grand Canyon is only two and a half hours away.) If you’re looking for family activities, there are pickleball and tennis courts on site. If you’re just looking to relax, there’s a lush spa—and four pools! And while there are three fantastic restaurants—​​Che Ah Chi, Tii Gavo, and Hummingbird at Mii amo—available at Enchantment, I usually opt for room service and order a s’mores kit we can enjoy around our own personal fire pit. —AC<br></p><h2 data-node-id title="Udaipur, India" data-anchor-id=udaipur-india class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Udaipur, India<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h2><img alt="a body of water with boats and buildings along it" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/facade-2b-66266dbadd9b9.jpg title="a body of water with boats and buildings along it" width=1280 height=959 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 data-node-id=109 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Taj Lake Palace</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=110 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Okay, I have to admit: I didn’t even stay at the Taj Lake Palace. I just went for dinner! But it was the most enchanting hotel I’ve ever visited. It rises up like a white marble island from the middle of Lake Pichola. Just getting there by boat, even if only for a single decadent meal, felt like an adventure. And once you step off the boat, the experience of opulence hits yet another level. Next time I’ll cap off dinner by spending the night in one of the palace’s sumptuous rooms overlooking the water. —LC</p><h2 data-node-id title="Washington, D.C." data-anchor-id=washington-dc class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emt9r7s1"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Washington, D.C.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h2><img alt="a room with a couch and chairs" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/eaton-0009-large-66267a7d9a86d.jpg title="a room with a couch and chairs" width=2606 height=1738 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><h2 data-node-id=113 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Eaton DC</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=114 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Every time I visit friends in Washington, D.C., I stay at the Eaton Hotel—it’s the perfect location for music lovers like me.
