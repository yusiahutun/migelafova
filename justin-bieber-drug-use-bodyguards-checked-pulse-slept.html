"It was like I had all this success and it was still like: I'm still sad, and I'm still in pain. And I still have these unresolved issues. And I thought all the success was going to make everything good. And so for me, the drugs were a numbing agent to just continue to get through."</p><p>Reflecting on the those dark days, Bieber said he had "lost control" of his career goals.</p><p>"And in this industry, you've got people that unfortunately prey on people's insecurities and use that to their benefit," he added. "And so when that happens, obviously that makes you angry. And then you're this young angry person who had these big dreams, and then the world just jades you and makes you into this person that you don't want to be."</p><p>Now Bieber credits his wife, <a href=#>Hailey Baldwin</a>, for helping pave his road to redemption, although he admitted <a href=#>their first year of marriage had some challenges</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:57b86f2a-6545-48c8-9b84-862d07469401 data-container-ref=toofab:article:b820f5b1-46a8-4937-9141-155f7553f3fe data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/93/5by4/2021/04/13/9380480c1cae480198d0e9b1111122cc_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Hailey Bieber Recalls 'Invasive' And 'Disrespectful' Moment Paparazzi Tried Filming Up Her Skirt</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Going back to the trauma stuff, there was just lack of trust. There was all these things that you don't want to admit to the person that you're with, because it's scary. You don't want to scare them off by saying, 'I'm scared.'"</p><p>Despite spending that first year "on eggshells," Justin said the couple are now working on "just creating these moments for us as a couple, as a family, that we’re building these memories."</p><p>"It’s beautiful that we have that to look forward to," he added. "Before, I didn't have that to look forward to in my life. My home life was unstable. Like, my home life was not existing. I didn't have a significant other. I didn't have someone to love. I didn't have someone to pour into. But now I have that."</p><p>He also gives thanks to his faith for helping him find the right track again.</p><p>"I came to a place where I just was like, 'God, if you're real, I need you to help me, because I can't do this on my own. Like, I'm struggling so hard.' Every time we mess up, he's picking us back up every single time. That's how I view it. And so it's like, 'I made a mistake. I won't dwell in it. I don't sit in shame. But it actually makes me want to do better.'"</p><a id=gallery-link-8a1cc45b-4b94-58ad-9512-18c10f3ddcaa class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:8a1cc45b-4b94-58ad-9512-18c10f3ddcaa data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:b820f5b1-46a8-4937-9141-155f7553f3fe data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/9d/4by3/2019/08/01/9d0e720d3916574fa2c6de5775821722_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j21mamxfn8K0wMinZJuhlZeys3nDq6ygZaWosm6uzp2woK2Rp7G0ecKhnJyjlZl6scHLrJxmq5yavbV7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjustin-bieber-drug-use-bodyguards-checked-pulse-slept.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjustin-bieber-drug-use-bodyguards-checked-pulse-slept.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjustin-bieber-drug-use-bodyguards-checked-pulse-slept.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjustin-bieber-drug-use-bodyguards-checked-pulse-slept.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjustin-bieber-drug-use-bodyguards-checked-pulse-slept.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjustin-bieber-drug-use-bodyguards-checked-pulse-slept.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./meaning-of-double-fantasy-mixed-by-the-weeknd.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./meaning-of-double-fantasy-mixed-by-the-weeknd.html>Meaning of Double Fantasy [Mixed] by The Weeknd</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./zodiac-signs-bratz.html>Zodiac Signs as Bratz DollsWhich One Are You?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./zodiac-signs-bratz.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
