And guess what? I'm still anxious.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So I was skeptical when I heard about ear seeding, which lists alleviating stress and anxiety as one of its many benefits. An ancient <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chinese medicine practice</a> similar to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>acupuncture</a> in nature, ear seeds aretiny seed-like beads that adhere to your ears and stimulate pressure points in your ear. They're used to treat a wide range of health concerns, including chronic pain, infertility, migraines, and insomnia — all without using any needles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sound too good to be true? Yeah, I thought so too — until I tried them out for myself and finally found relief from my chronic anxiety. Here's everything you need to know about ear seeds if you're interested in giving the practice a try for yourself.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-ear-seeding-and-how-does-it-work></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Ear Seeding and How Does It Work?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A traditional Chinese medicine practice with similar benefits to acupuncture, ear seeding addresses problem areas and concerns by pressing on your ear's acupressure points — but only in your ear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The ear in Chinese medicine is a microcosm of the body, meaning our whole body, including our neurological map, is mapped within the ear," explains Gudrun Snyder, a doctor of East Asian Medicine, and the founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Moon Rabbit Acupuncture</a> in Chicago.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Through Chinese medicine history, people would place the needles and then see what happened," she says. "And then over time, they found that these certain points worked on certain parts of your body." Basically, this was all discovered by trial and error!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Contrary to traditional acupuncture, there aren't any needles involved in ear seeding. Instead, you're using "seeds" — often 24K gold plated pellets with stainless steel bases — that you place in the specific part of the ear that correlates with the concern you hope to address. (They even look kind of trendy — always a bonus in my book!)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-i-apply-ear-seeds></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do I Apply Ear Seeds?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to application, Dr. Snyder says it's actually incredibly easy and doesn't have to be super precise, so it can be done either by a professional or in the comfort of your own home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's how at-home application works: Simply clean your ear prior to application — I used witch hazel ($4; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>target.com</a>) — peel the adhesive off the backing, and place the seeds approximately in the area that treats the concern according to the map provided with your ear seeding kit. And again, don't fret when it comes to the exact placement of the seeds, Dr. Snyder says, as everyone's ears will be slightly different.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Then, leave them on for five days (through showers, pools, weather, etc.), feel better, peel off, and repeat! If you're looking to get your hands on a pack of your own, Dr. Snyder recommends the WTHN Ear Seed Kit ($45; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>wthn.com</a>), which you can also purchase from her practice ($45; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>moonrabbitacupuncture.com</a>), or try the stylish NAO Wellness Swarovski kit ($35; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>amazon.com</a>).</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kaitlyn Collins / InStyle</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-benefits-of-ear-seeding></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are the Benefits of Ear Seeding?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The health concerns that ear seeds target includes infertility, back pain, insomnia, weight loss, anxiety, depression, hormone regulation, and migraines ... the list goes on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One major benefit of ear seeding, and a draw for many, is their ability to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>alleviate stress</a>, which Dr. Snyder says is addressed through the Shen Men point. "In Chinese, it means spirit gate. That is how we access the spirit to calm your mind." She also tells me that Shen Men can be used to calm your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system (a.k.a., your fight or flight response). Many of Dr. Snyder's patients combine the practice with talk therapy and/or medication for a holistic approach to their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>mental health</a>, she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another popular use for ear seeds is balancing your hormones. For this, apply a seed to the pressure point also known as the .0 in Chinese Medicine, says Dr. Snyder, which helps serve as a "reset" button to get those hormones back in line.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Snyder says that while there are studies showing acupuncture can reduce stress levels and increase <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dopamine</a> and serotonin (our happy hormones), there isn't a ton of scientific evidence to back up the how and why of ear seeding. However, she notes that she has seen them work "magic" on her patients, so she's a big proponent of giving the practice a try if it's affordable for you and fits into your lifestyle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, how long does it take to actually notice any effect? Dr. Snyder says that how quickly you notice results can vary from person to person — some people feel it immediately, others need the full five days to feel results. She likens it to exercise: It's best to wear the ear seeds consistently at first to see results and achieve long-term results. Just be sure to switch them out for a new set after five days, as the adhesive can get gunky, says Dr. Snyder.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-ear-seeds-worked-for-my-anxiety></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Ear Seeds Worked for My Anxiety</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When I was deciding where I wanted to place my ear seeds, my main priority was tackling my stress and anxiety, two areas I've struggled with practically my entire life — I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in elementary school. So I decided to place my seeds in location A on the map above for stress relief, as well as at spot E for hormone balance, and spot J, which is linked to your liver in Chinese Medicine, for a little detox.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While it's impossible to know how much my hormones or liver were really affected in such a short time (unless I were to have my hormones and liver levels tested), overall, I felt healthy and balanced and motivated to keep using them for longer-term results, especially when it came to my mental health.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like most people, the state of my mental health ebbs and flows, even with traditional talk therapy combined with some prescription meds. Lately, for reasons I will not bore you with, my anxiety has been off the charts, so I was really excited to give this a go. And let me just tell you that my anxiety was pretty much subdued by the next day. Of course, there's no way of knowing if this was the reason for my fleeting stress, but I felt better practically overnight, even after an anxiety-inducing couple of days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My takeaway from my week with ear seeds is that they're affordable, quick, easy, and trendy in a cool-girl type of way to help alleviate some common problems that a lot of us suffer from. While it's hard to know, or scientifically measure, if the seeds are working, there's no harm in giving it a shot. Because all I know is, that I felt less anxious by the next day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While I was admittedly skeptical going in, I'm counting this ear seeding experiment a success and will continue to (stylishly) treat my concerns with a pack of ear seeds for the foreseeable future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8SaqWarlZqxtHnGrqCdnQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fear-seeds-guide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fear-seeds-guide.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fear-seeds-guide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fear-seeds-guide.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fear-seeds-guide.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fear-seeds-guide.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./martin-compston-dramas-worth-watching.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./martin-compston-dramas-worth-watching.html>6 Martin Compston dramas worth checking out: Traces, The Nest, Our House and more</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./us-navy-seals-shift-focus-counterterrorism-global.html>US Navy Seals to shift focus from counterterrorism to global threats</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./us-navy-seals-shift-focus-counterterrorism-global.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
