At a time when many neighbouring bars are empty as a result of President Rodrigo Duterte’s bloody war on drugs, the Ringside’s boxing dwarfs are pulling in money-spinning crowds.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669g8F class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>But while the benefits for the bar owners are obvious, the rewards for the dwarfs are comparatively minuscule. They earn just 250 pesos (HK$39, US$5) a night – little more than the price of one customer drink in the bar – and, insultingly, have 50 pesos of that withheld as a fee for laundering their boxing outfits, employees say.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/14/20278e94-1e70-11e7-ba38-4217a96bb749_1320x770_113138.JPG><p datatype="p" id=U10120425666921G class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“It’s barely enough to live on, especially when they have to travel long distances from their accommodation to get to work every night,” says one of the bar girls who sidle up to customers as they watch the bouts. “They’re really not treated well at all.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669fkD class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>The Ringside’s owners declined requests from Post Magazine for an interview.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669aEB class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>The bar is not alone in its questionable treatment of dwarfs in the Philippines, where working in entertainment venues is one of the few employment options open to them. With no effective welfare or health care system and wide­spread discrimination against the disabled, they inhabit a twilight world.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">There is a folk belief that whatever a woman craves during pregnancy will imprint her child’s characteristicsGlorian Tomen</figure><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669R0B class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Now, however, there are stirrings of change as Manila’s little people – their preferred form of address; “midget” is highly offensive – begin to demand their rights. An organi­sation has been established to lobby for greater employment rights, public awareness, medical assistance and social welfare protection.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669lUH class="c5 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Little People of the Philippines has been set up by 1.17-metre Glorian Tomen, a quietly spoken, articulate 26-year-old from Angeles City, 75km north of Manila, who overcame a childhood of cruel taunts to graduate from college and take up a local government job as a writer and researcher.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669Y1G class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“Children would follow me and tease me and say, ‘Look at the unano,’” she says, using the derogatory Tagalog term for dwarf. “My grandmother taught me to turn around to them and say, ‘So what?

I thought, ‘How will I survive four years of that?’ When I was in my first year there, though, I met new friends and became more positive.

There, she was stunned and then inspired by the vast differences in the way people with her condition are treated in other countries and the relatively generous options available to them.<p datatype="p" id=U1012042566699TD class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>In the Philippines, there has been little civil action on behalf of people with dwarfism since a failed campaign six years ago to set up a village in Manila specifically for dwarfs. Tomen’s more ambitious goals are not segregation but rather integration and equality.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669qXG class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Tomen has never visited the Ringside but shakes her head at descriptions of how it operates and calls it “degrading”.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669xXF class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“People in the Philippines don’t understand what dwarfism is about and they make people like us the butt of ridicule,” she says. “I hope my fellow little people can find jobs that better suit them without this kind of thing. The government should give more support so that little people can get jobs that do not degrade them.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669xoF class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Tomen is speaking as she prepares for her group’s first general assembly, to be held in a well-known venue less than 5km from the Ringside.

Tomen is now arranging quarterly meetings and lobbying officials at the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare and Development to attend and field questions on their policies for helping little people.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669v5 class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>In an address to the February assembly, Tomen told the audience: “Whether you are small or tall, whether you are disabled or not, your physical appearance should never stop you achieving your dreams.

None of those interviewed had ever had their form of dwarfism diagnosed and many held superstitious beliefs about the causes of their condition, with some still sub­scribing to the countrywide myth that dwarfism is caused by illness or diet during pregnancy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/14/388693fe-1e70-11e7-ba38-4217a96bb749_1320x770_113138.JPG><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669YpG class="c8 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“My No 1 question was, ‘What kind of dwarfism do you have?’ and most said they did not know,” says Tomen. “There is a folk belief that whatever a woman craves during pregnancy will imprint her child’s characteristics. One of the interviewees told me her mother got sick and had pneumonia during pregnancy and that was the reason she was born the way she was. I was very saddened by the answers people gave me.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U1012042566692uF class="c8 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>These deep-rooted suspicions breed a fatalism that stops people with dwarfism seeking medical help – a potentially life-altering omission with conditions that can leave sufferers prone to sclerosis and hip and bone problems. Those prob­lems are inevitably exacerbated by activities such as boxing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/04/14/43880d46-1e70-11e7-ba38-4217a96bb749_600x_113138.JPG>One of the people who inspired Tomen at the Berlin sum­mit was Gary Arnold, president of Little People of America, a charity that provides support to individuals with dwarfism and their families. Arnold appeals to tourists and expatriates to boycott venues such as the Ringside.<p datatype="p" id=U101204256669QmD class="c1 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“I hope people will stay away. The more we support this kind of thing, the more it sends the message that it is some­how OK,” he says, in a telephone interview from the US. “It reinforces antiquated myths and stereotypes of little people being objects of entertainment for the larger community.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669GgC class="c8 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Arnold – whose group lobbied unsuccess­fully to have scenes of dwarf tossing edited out of the hit 2013 movie <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The Wolf of Wall Street</span></a> – appeals to little people to take a stand and refuse jobs such as those at the Ringside.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669jUE class="c8 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“People say it’s their choice to be involved in this kind of entertainment,” he says. “But when that entertain­ment is based upon objectification of an entire group of people it affects everyone, so we are justified in trying to stop it.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669wVB class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“I recognise opportunity is limited for marginalised com­munities in places like the Philippines but the answer is not to objectify people and take advantage of their differences.

Holding up a poster saying “Disability rights are human rights” he told them: “Now more than ever we need to work together inter­nationally to address the issues facing people with dwarfism as well as the issues that face all people with disabilities.”</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669N4H class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>For Tomen, however, one of the biggest challenges is persuading little people who have been ridiculed and excluded from regular society from an early age to stand up for themselves and press for equality in a country where the disabled and the under­privileged face crushingly bleak prospects.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669yYD class="c8 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Nevertheless, it is a fight she is deter­mined to win and one upon which far more depends than the degrading nightly spectacle at the Ringside cheered on by foreigners whose presence, in the view of anti-discrimination campaigners, makes them complicit in the exploitation.</p><p datatype="p" id=U101204256669hVD class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>“Too many little people are afraid to speak out and just want to hide themselves away,” Tomen says. “They are marginalised and made to take on menial jobs.
