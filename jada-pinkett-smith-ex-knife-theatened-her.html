Despite them "hardly" knowing each other and her insistence she wasn't looking for anything serious, he "persisted" -- even offering to "pay close to seven hundred thousand dollars toward the renovation" of a farmhouse she had in Maryland at the time.</p><p>"His gesture didn't feel like generosity, it felt like a way to entrap me," she wrote, saying her mother even warned her she felt "something is off about him."

When she wanted to visit Tupac in the hospital after he was shot at Quad Studios in 1994, she added he reacted in a way which "didn't score him any points with me," scoffing at the idea they were only "friends."</p><p>After she returned from visiting Tupac in the hospital and getting him set up at Jasmine Guy's home for his recovery, she continued having constant contact with them both -- something she assumed "gnawed at Lance." She was also fielding calls from Spike Lee about working together on Girl 6, something which Lance showed no interest in.</p><p>Amid all that, Jada and Lance went out to dinner with a friend of his, before getting into a "minor dispute" which "erupted into an explosive reaction from him" on the drive home. "His intensity never really felt safe, so as usual, my reaction was to try and stay levelheaded," wrote Jada, adding that Lance's friend was also in the car with them and attempted to calm him down. When that didn't work, she realized "this was not going to end well," pointing out how Lance was "all muscle" and had also been drinking.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:59e87f71-1e72-418b-98dd-242e0061e130 data-container-ref=toofab:article:316525de-a6a8-48f6-b258-6435149d015f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/14/5by4/2023/10/16/14490dff473643b4ab27f6352e95b3fb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jada Pinkett Smith Details Hitting 'Rock Bottom,' Using Ayahuasca During Recovery 'Journey' (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>It was then she threw herself out of the car, which was near Lance's home, before running to the house, changing into her sweatpants and sneakers and grabbing "the biggest knife he had" before hiding in his child's bedroom. She then realized she was "trapped," so ran for it before getting into a "standoff" with Lance in the hallway -- holding the knife in front of her face, while warning him to stay away.</p><p>Thankfully, Lance's friend came into the house and deescalated the situation enough for him to apologize and Jada to feign acceptance. She then started packing, telling him she had to go meet with Spike Lee the next morning, promising to return after.</p><p>"The next morning, Lance said, 'I'm never going to see you again, am I?'" Jada recalled. "I put on my brightest, most forgiving smile and said, 'Of course you will," she added -- saying she then got on the plane "thankful the lie had worked."</p><p>Jada <a href=#><strong>previously opened up about the incident on an episode of Red Table Talk</strong></a>, saying that she ran into the man again when she was with <a href=#><strong>Will Smith</strong></a>. At the time, she went on to say that he was "not a bad guy at all," but was someone who "just had those tendencies of violence."</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><strong>Her book, Worthy, is available Tuesday October 17.</strong></a></p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5346a11a-d449-40d5-9cdb-f683f0abd5a4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:316525de-a6a8-48f6-b258-6435149d015f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4e/5by4/2021/11/09/4ef60f5a3da44860b1e38588f901e278_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Why Jada Pinkett Smith Turned Down Tupac Proposal, How She Keeps His Memory Alive with Kids (Exclusive Details)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmam5fn66lrYypoKejlanBbr%2FMoquhZZWteqy6yJ%2BcZqyYmq61sc2em2aglad8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjada-pinkett-smith-ex-knife-theatened-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjada-pinkett-smith-ex-knife-theatened-her.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjada-pinkett-smith-ex-knife-theatened-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjada-pinkett-smith-ex-knife-theatened-her.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjada-pinkett-smith-ex-knife-theatened-her.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjada-pinkett-smith-ex-knife-theatened-her.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-royal-tea-gifts-to-shop.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-royal-tea-gifts-to-shop.html>Best coronation tea gifts: M&amp;amp;S, Selfridges, Harrods &amp;amp; more</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sly-stallone-now-understands-hollywood-star-he-spent-decades-loathing.html>Sly Stallone now 'understands' Hollywood star he spent decades 'loathing'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sly-stallone-now-understands-hollywood-star-he-spent-decades-loathing.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
