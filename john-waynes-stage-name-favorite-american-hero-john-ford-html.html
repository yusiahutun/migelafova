Wayne was born Marion Michael Morrison. Most fans of The Duke know that by now, but did you know it was Stagecoach <a href=#>director John Ford</a> who named him? And did you know what his last name was based on?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/John-Wayne-stage-name-Marion-Morrison.jpg><p id=par-2_41>This is one of the stories revealed on a new 4K UHD edition of the classic western <a href=#>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</a>, now available. In the bonus features, Ford himself tells the story of naming Wayne after Wayne’s own hero.</p><h2>John Wayne was credited as ‘Duke Morrison’ before he got his name&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-3_50>From 1926 – 1929, Wayne <a href=#>appeared uncredited in many movies</a>. Only one, Words and Music, credited him at all and called him Duke Morrison. The Duke nickname, from his childhood, would stick. But, when Wayne got a lead role in The Big Trail, director Raoul Walsh wanted to rename him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_84>“He had an athletic scholarship but he had to work on the side,” Ford said. “That’s how he came into pictures. Raoul Walsh was doing a big western and he came to me and said, ‘I like your boy Wayne. Can he act?’ I said, ‘He’s a very, very good natural actor.’ He says, ‘I want to test him for the lead of this picture’ which he did. Duke got the part. Raoul and I talked about his name, which was Marion Michael Morrison.”</p><h2>John Ford named John Wayne after Mad Anthony Wanye</h2><p id=par-5_48>“Mad” Anthony Wayne was a Revolutionary War general. Mad Anthony was so-called for his temper. He led troops in the Battles of Brandywine, Paoli, Germantown, Monmouth, Stony Point, Bull’s Ferry, and Green Spring. The actor Wayne would appear in a number of modern war movies amid his westerns.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Celebrate John Wayne Day in the Fort Worth Stockyards with us!

Who was your favorite American hero?’ This is before McArthur became famous, Douglas McArther. He says, ‘I’ve always liked Mad Anthony Wayne.’ I said, ‘That’s a good name, John Wayne.’ He says, ‘So be it.’”</p><h2 id=h-the-two-syllables-of-a-movie-star>The two syllables of a movie star&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-7_32>John Wayne starred in many films of the ‘30s. It was Ford’s Stagecoach that <a href=#>made him a western icon</a> in 1939. But, Ford had already given him his name a decade earlier.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_81>“So they advertise him as John Wayne,” Ford said. “He’s been John Wayne ever since. He wanted a name sort of similar to mine. I think I was more of a father image to him. He lost his father early in life. Instead of a big brother, I think I was more of a father image to him. He always said I direct him in pictures and I directed his life. Well, that’s a broad statement but it is partly true.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3sLTNZq6asZ6awG6%2F05qenmWelrqmecWaraiqmamybq3Mnqmim5Gjeqmx0ahko6eYo3qnu9GdZaGsnaF8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-waynes-stage-name-favorite-american-hero-john-ford-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohn-waynes-stage-name-favorite-american-hero-john-ford-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohn-waynes-stage-name-favorite-american-hero-john-ford-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohn-waynes-stage-name-favorite-american-hero-john-ford-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-waynes-stage-name-favorite-american-hero-john-ford-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-waynes-stage-name-favorite-american-hero-john-ford-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kelly-ripa-reveals-husband-mark-consuelos-sleep-habits.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kelly-ripa-reveals-husband-mark-consuelos-sleep-habits.html>Kelly Ripa Reveals Husband Mark Consuelos Shocking Sleep Habits Amid Return to Live</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./546241-dj-mo-savagely-responds-fan-teach-daughter-wambo-swahili-lea-wako.html>DJ Mo Savagely Responds to Fan Asking Him to Teach Daughter Wambo Kiswahili: &amp;quot;Lea Wako&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./546241-dj-mo-savagely-responds-fan-teach-daughter-wambo-swahili-lea-wako.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
