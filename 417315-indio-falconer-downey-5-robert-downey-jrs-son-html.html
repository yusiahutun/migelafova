Also, he has done fewer interviews compared to his peers whose parents are A-list celebrities. These two factors have created a public persona, which is often misunderstood.</p><h2>5 things to know about Indio Falconer Downey</h2><p class=align-left>Robert Downey Junior is one of the greatest actors and producers of all time. If you are one of his fans, you must be interested in knowing more about his son Indio Falconer Dowey. Here are the five things you should know about Robert Downey Jr’s son.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/db67cac2afbededb.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kecalf Cunningham: What you should know about Aretha Franklin's son</span></p></a><h3>1. Indio spent most of his childhood with his dad</h3><p class=align-left>When Indio’s parents divorced, his mother was fortunate to get the child’s custody. However, she allowed the young boy to spend time with his <a href=#>celebrity</a> dad. As a result, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the young Indio appeared in events with his father.</p><p class=align-left>His father also took him to movie premieres and interviews. Thanks to the exposure, the young Indio started loving acting. Even though he did not get the first acting role until 2005, observing his dad for years made his movie debut one of the best debuts in the 2000s.</p><p class=align-left>Apart from his father influencing Indio to act, many have associated his relationship with Robert Downey to his drug problem. Unfortunately, both Indio and his dad have never commented on the allegations.</p><h3>2. He has played in two bands</h3><p class=align-left>Even though his dad’s fans expected Indio to pursue acting as a full-time actor, he took a different path. He is a vocalist and a talented guitarist. Since the early 2010s, he has been in two bands, The Seems and The Dose Band.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/33baaa39d0aa2656.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How many kids does Future have?

As a result, the band <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">received a lot of buzz </a>in the bands’ scene. Apart from writing, they received a lot of attention for their playing style, which had a lot of 1990s influence.</p><p class=align-left>Besides being one of the biggest underground bands in LA, Indio and the band received offers from big record companies such as Warner Bros. Unfortunately, the partnership between the music giant and the young band did not see the light of the day. Also, after recording one single, which received a lot of attention from LA radio stations, they split in 2013.</p><p class=align-left>Later, Indio formed the second band The Dose Band. Unlike the first music group, he has been consistent with The Dose Band in recording music and touring. The most successful project by the band is Saline.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0aca0fc70e4f6549.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Travis Bacon: 7 things you didn't know about Kevin Bacon's son</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/db67cac2afbededb.jpeg><h3>3. Indio has only acted in two movies</h3><p class=align-left>Even though his father is one of the biggest movie stars of our time, Indio has appeared in only two movies. However, he was a cast member in 2005 <i>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang </i>and Jackie in 2016.</p><p class=align-left>He played the Harry Lockhart character in<i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</a></i>. Even though he had a more prominent role in his second movie, the 2005 movie is his most significant performance. Interestingly, his father, Robert Downey Jr, was also an actor in the film. However, he was the lead actor while Indio was a supporting actor.</p><p class=align-left>After 11 years, he acted in Jackie, a 2016 movie. Unlike the previous film, his role in the new film was significant, and Indio had more screen time. Unfortunately, the film was his last performance as an<a href=#> actor</a>. Also, he did not appear in tours to promote the film due to personal problems such as drug allegations.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/079141f9086b2838.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does Harry Styles have a daughter?

He has a net worth of $2 million</h3><p class=align-left>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celeb Net Worth</a>, Indio Falconer Downey’s net worth is estimated to be $2 million. He has accumulated his wealth through music and a few acting gigs. Unfortunately, the only <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Forbes coverage </a>of his personality was drug-related and not about his worth.</p><p class=align-left>The singer has two primary sources of income. First, Indio earns from his previous movies and music. But since he is now a full-time <a href=#>musician</a>, music is his primary source of income and wealth.</p><p class=align-left>However, the composer does not have another revenue stream.
