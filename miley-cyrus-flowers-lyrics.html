The song directly references moments from their marriage and serves as a self-empowerment anthem.</p><p>Cyrus and Hemsworth<a href=# rel=noopener> married in 2018</a> and announced their split less than a year later in 2019. The couple definitely had their ups and downs—including a pretty disastrous experience in late 2018, when California wildfires wiped out their home in Malibu. Cyrus told Howard Stern that she and the 30-year-old Hunger Games star “lost everything.” Miley references the disaster in the first verse “We were right ’til we weren’t / Built a home and watched it burn.” In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a> in 2020, she revealed that the fire “did what I couldn’t do myself”. “It removed me from what no longer was serving its purpose,” she told the magazine. “And then as you drown, you reach for that lifesaver and you want to save yourself. I think that’s really what, ultimately, getting married was for me. One last attempt to save myself.”</p><p>She continued to talk about her relationship with Hemsworth with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Howard Stern</a> in December 2020. “Me being an intense person and not wanting to sit with it and not wanting to go, you know, ‘What could be purposeful about this?’ I just clung to what I had left of that house, which was me and him,” she told Stern. “And I really do and did love him very, very, very much and still do, always will.”</p><p>Cyrus and Hemsworth were in an on-and-off relationship since 2009 when they met on the set of The Last Song. In one instance in an interview with Howard Stern, Miley also revealed that she didn’t think her and Hemsworth would ever <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tie the knot</a>. “We were together since 16,” she said.&nbsp; “Our house burned down. We had been like, engaged—I don’t know if we really ever thought we were actually going to get married, but when we lost our house in Malibu—which if you listen to my voice pre- and post-fire, they’re very different so that trauma really affected my voice. And I was actually in South Africa, so I couldn’t come home, and like, my animals were tied to a post at the beach. I lost everything.”</p><p>The chorus of the song interpolates lyrics of “When I Was Your Man” by Bruno Mars. However, instead of yearning for love or getting back with an ex, Miley explores the theme of self-love and doing everything on her own. “I can buy myself flowers/Write my name in the sand/Talk to myself for hours/Yeah, some things you don’t understand,” she sings on the track. “But I can take myself dancing, yeah/I can hold my own hand/ Yeah, I can love me better than you can.” The music video also reflects this self-love as the singer is seen strutting through the streets and hills of Los Angeles.</p><p>Pop culture Twitter PopTingz claimed that the set of the<a href=# rel=noopener> music video</a> was where Hemsworth allegedly cheated on Cyrus with 14 women. “The house where the music video for Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers” was recorded was previously used by Liam Hemsworth to cheat on Miley with more than 14 women while they were married,” the account tweeted, but the tweet itself is unverified. The tweet went viral with more than 40,000 likes and 10,000 retweets. Miley’s sister Brandi also responded to the rumor on the Your Favorite Thing&nbsp;podcast. “It makes Miley seem like an absolute genius. And it’s just too good. Like, every day I wake up to a new one. The first one was something about this Bruno Mars song. They’re like, ‘Liam played the Bruno Mars song at their wedding! And this is a response to the Bruno Mars song.’ That one’s funny,” she said.</p><p>She continued, “Then there was, ‘The suit she’s wearing is the suit Liam wore at the Avengers premiere, where he told her that she needed to behave for once. And so this is a f—k you because she’s in the suit.’ Hilarious. Then the other one was, ‘The house is the house where Liam used to take people [to] cheat on her with.’ The narratives are fucking hilarious, but it’s so great. The best PR that could ever happen because it gets people talking about the song on TikTok and it’s everywhere. And it’s just so fun to watch it all play out. Miley fans, I love ya.” As for if the rumors are true, Brandi told the podcast, “I’m not here to say that’s true and what’s not true. Only Miley knows the truth.”</p><p>Though, the Bangerz songstress denied the cheating rumors when she was fresh out of the divorce. &nbsp;In August 2019, she&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">tweeted,</a>&nbsp;“The truth is, once Liam & I reconciled, I meant it, & I was committed. There are NO secrets to uncover here. I’ve learned from every experience in my life. I’m not perfect, I don’t want to be, it’s boring. I’ve grown up in front of you, but the bottom line is, I HAVE GROWN UP. I can admit to a lot of things but I refuse to admit that my marriage ended because of cheating. Liam and I have been together for a decade. I’ve said it before & it remains true, I love Liam and always will.” She continued, “BUT at this point, I had to make a healthy decision for myself to leave a previous life behind. I am the healthiest and happiest I have been in a long time. You can say I am a twerking, pot-smoking, foul-mouthed hillbilly but I am not a liar.”</p><p>Miley’s godmother and icon Dolly Parton said that the song was clearly inspired by the “Wrecking Ball” singer’s life. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> on January 17, 2023, the “Jolene” songwriter said, “I love that song. Miley is so great. I mean, I just am so proud of her as a singer and songwriter. I don’t know who wrote that, but I have a feeling she had plenty to do with it. It was her story if not her actual writing.” On February 21, 2022, Liam’s sister-in-law <a href=# rel=noopener>Elsa Pataky</a> responded to the rumors that the Hunger Games star cheated on Miley, “It’s a very old topic for us,” she said when addressing the couple’s break up. “If someone should talk it should be Liam, but I think she [Miley] can do what she wants.”</p><p>As of February 22, 2023, the single has been Number 1 on the Billboard charts for five consecutive weeks. “Celebrating “Flowers” being #1 around the world again this week!” Miley <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">tweeted</a>. “I love that this record is connecting in such a positive way & it’s a pleasure to continue creating music for you. These milestones are only made possible by the listeners & my incredible fans. Endlessly thankful.”</p><p>Miley released her latest album Endless Summer Vacation on March 10, 2023. Miley explained that her new album is split into two parts, with <a href=# rel=noopener>“River”</a> starting the second part as the P.M. part. “In the nighttime, it feels that there’s a slinky, seediness, and kind of a grime, but a glamor at the same time. In the evening, it’s a great time for rest, it’s a time to recover — or, it’s a time to go out and experience the wild side,” she said in her Disney Plus special <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Backyard Sessions</a> in March 2023. “In L.A. there’s a certain energy to the night that you can kind of feel trouble boil up to the surface and it’s very inspiring to me.”</p><p>The album contains even more songs about alleged cheating and many people speculated it to be about Liam as well. She went in-depth about the song “River”&nbsp;in her Disney Plus special “The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Backyard Sessions</a>” in March 2023. “It was a time in my life where I was going through just a lot emotionally and personally, and I guess all my songs kind of evolve,” she said. “They can start as something that was a trouble, like, it just feels like it’s an April shower. It never stops raining. And then it started raining down like love.”</p><p>She continued in the special,&nbsp;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">“</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">River</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&nbsp;sometimes we just need to dance for a banger a.k.a they dont want me to talk about how the fact the song is about,” the clip cuts out with a censor bleep. “It’s f—ing nasty.”</span></p><p>Fans theorized that it bleep censored out the word for ejaculation, while others also kept on the theory that it might be about her ex-husband Liam Hemsworth and his cheating scandals.</p><p>The<a href=# rel=noopener> lyrics to “Muddy Feet”</a> are pretty blunt about her anger towards a partner who is guilty of cheating. “I don’t know / Who the hell you think you’re messin’ with / Get the f*ck out of my house with that sh*t / Get the f*ck out of my life with that sh*t.” She later sings, “And you smell like perfume that I didn’t purchase / Now I know why you’ve been closing the curtains / Get the f*ck out of my house.” Miley hasn’t verified the reports that it’s about her ex Liam Hemsworth, but like “Flowers” it kind of heads in that direction. “Muddy Waters” even slyly references another type of flower: “<span class="ReferentFragmentdesktop__Highlight-sc-110r0d9-1 jAzSMw">You’ve watered the weeds and you killed all the roses.”</span></p><p>Read Miley Cyrus’ “Flowers” Lyrics down below via <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Genius.</a></p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>Miley Cyrus “Flowers” Lyrics</h2><p>[Verse 1]<br>We were good, we were gold<br>Kinda dream that can’t be sold<br>We were right ’til we weren’t<br>Built a home and watched it burn</p><p>[Pre-Chorus]<br>Mmm, I didn’t wanna leave you, I didn’t wanna lie<br>Started to cry, but then remembered I</p><p>[Chorus]<br>I can buy myself flowers<br>Write my name in the sand<br>Talk to myself for hours<br>Say things you don’t understand<br>I can take myself dancing<br>And I can hold my own hand<br>Yeah, I can love me better than you can</p><p>[Post-Chorus]<br>Can love me better, I can love me better, baby<br>Can love me better, I can love me better, baby</p><p>[Verse 2]<br>Paint my nails cherry-red<br>Match the roses that you left<br>No remorse, no regret<br>I forgive every word you said</p><p>[Pre-Chorus]<br>Ooh, I didn’t wanna leave you, baby, I didn’t wanna fight<br>Started to cry, but then remembered I</p><p>[Chorus]<br>I can buy myself flowers<br>Write my name in the sand<br>Talk to myself for hours, yeah<br>Say things you don’t understand<br>I can take myself dancing, yeah<br>I can hold my own hand<br>Yeah, I can love me better than you can</p><p>[Post-Chorus]<br>Can love me better, I can love me better, baby<br>Can love me better, I can love me better, baby<br>Can love me better, I can love me better, baby<br>Can love me better, I (Ooh, I)</p><p>[Bridge]<br>I didn’t wanna leave you, I didn’t wanna fight<br>Started to cry, but then remembered I</p><p>[Chorus]<br>I can buy myself flowers (Uh-huh)<br>Write my name in the sand<br>Talk to myself for hours (Yeah)<br>Say things you don’t understand (Better than you)<br>I can take myself dancing (Yeah)<br>I can hold my own hand<br>Yeah, I can love me better than<br>Yeah, I can love me better than you can</p><p>[Post-Chorus]<br>Can love me better, I can love me better, baby (Uh)<br>Can love me better, I can love me better, baby (Than you can)<br>Can love me better, I can love me better, baby<br>Can love me better, I</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/endless-summer-vacation-miley-cyrus.jpg><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
