But his account was far kinder.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Caroline, sober, the real Caroline, is the sweetest, kindest, gentlest most loving person you could ever meet,' he wrote.

'She was a national treasure,' she said of Aherne.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>It is never easy to decipher the truth when the glare of celebrity distorts a story.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>And yet, from Peter Hook's side, every person we speak to mentions the word 'honest' when describing him. Trevor Johnson worked for Factory Records and the Hacienda nightclub — the musical hub of Manchester in the Nineties — and knew Hook professionally during his marriage to Caroline.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He said the first he knew of any serious problems was this week when he saw reports of the battered husband claims — yet he had no doubt that Hook's report would have been accurate.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'All I can say is they presented themselves in a certain way for the public.

I have known Hooky for a long time.

A lot of this did come as a surprise, but his relationship with Caroline was a nightmare. They just brought out the worst in each other.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Hooky has many faults, but being dishonest isn't one of them. He just tells it as it is.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But there are times when his bluntness is horribly inappropriate.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>His book includes a throwaway story about arriving at the undertaker's to arrange his mother's funeral. He was high on drugs and, when told the funeral director was absent because of a bereavement, enquired: 'Does he get a discount?'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Back then his 'acting like a loon', as he puts it, was forgiven. 'Everybody put it down to grief,' he writes, clearly amused.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Alas, he can't cite grief as an excuse for his attack on the woman he once swore to love and cherish.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Indeed, as he proudly writes, he did not join in the mass outpouring of grief at Caroline's death and could not, in good conscience, pay his respects.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But will he come to regret being so eye-wateringly candid about a woman whom so many idolise?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>One thing is sure. It isn't just his ex-wife's reputation he has trashed in writing this book. His own is in pieces, too.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn%2BXbGxpb2BkoamxjJyprp2cobK0wIybnK2qka6urXmzoamenV2ivK%2FAx6xknZ2RqbVuj8CrpqWhnpp6grTEq6Vmq12axW601KyZmqaUYq%2Bzrc2dnJ1lo5rFbrnAnWSvoZ%2Bhsq%2FAjJ2prqabY7W1ucs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-cruellest-betrayal-three-months-death-caroline-ahern-s-ex-husband-branded-sex-mad-violent-drunk-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-cruellest-betrayal-three-months-death-caroline-ahern-s-ex-husband-branded-sex-mad-violent-drunk-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-cruellest-betrayal-three-months-death-caroline-ahern-s-ex-husband-branded-sex-mad-violent-drunk-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-cruellest-betrayal-three-months-death-caroline-ahern-s-ex-husband-branded-sex-mad-violent-drunk-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-cruellest-betrayal-three-months-death-caroline-ahern-s-ex-husband-branded-sex-mad-violent-drunk-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-cruellest-betrayal-three-months-death-caroline-ahern-s-ex-husband-branded-sex-mad-violent-drunk-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./66290484268e3ee1768b4575-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./66290484268e3ee1768b4575-html.html>F1: Confirmado, el Real Madrid y Ferrari ya comparten a HP como patrocinador</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./otter-facts.html>50 Irresistible Otter Facts That You Never Knew About</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./otter-facts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
