"I got letters from hairdressers all over the country, telling me that I was affecting their business because their clients were having their hair cut off so they could wear it like the girl on television," she shared on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Oprah's Master Class</a> back in 2014.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pam-grier-in-hit-man-1972></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pam Grier in "Hit Man," 1972</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pam Grier was the it-girl of the 1970s. Throughout the decade, the acclaimed actress rocked a beautiful Afro throughout most of her films, including Hit Man, encouraging other Black women to do the same.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-esther-rolle-in-good-times-1974-to-1979></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Esther Rolle in "Good Times," 1974 to 1979</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With her cropped Afro and signature gap, the beloved and relatable Florida Evans, played by Esther Rolle, became a staple in Black households throughout the 1970s. The character was so loved that she went from a reoccurring role on Maude to starring in her own series Good Times.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lisa-bonet-in-the-cosby-show-1984-to-1992></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lisa Bonet in "The Cosby Show," 1984 to 1992</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While locs have become more normalized over the years, Lisa Bonet shocked The Cosby Show fans when she returned to the show with the look in the late '80s. However, the actress, who herself has been labeled as a sex symbol for decades, proved that this ancestral style not only belonged on television, but was just as beautiful as any other hairstyle.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-janet-jackson-in-poetic-justice-1993></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Janet Jackson in "Poetic Justice," 1993</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from Brandy's Moesha style, Janet Jackson's hair from her 1993 role in Poetic Justice has gone down in history as one of the most iconic braided looks of all time. To this day, Black women still point to Justice's braids as inspiration for their current styles.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-brandy-in-moesha-1996-to-2001></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Brandy in "Moesha," 1996 to 2001</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking of Moesha, Brandy helped to usher in the modern day era of protective styles, which, of course, were inspired by ancestral looks. Nearly every Black girl in the '90s and early '00s wanted "Brandy braids." Oh, and who can forget the time Moesha Mitchell refused to take down her hair in order to fit in with her peers at her new private school? Absolutely legendary.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-brandy-in-cinderella-1997></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Brandy in "Cinderella," 1997</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Disney</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from the UPN series, Brandy totally changed the game when she starred in Cinderella. With her performance, finally, we were able to see the classic fairytale in a whole new light. This version (which also starred the incredible Whitney Houston) proved that Black girls, with our brown skin, wide noses, and braids — features we were taught were "wrong" or "bad" — could be princesses, too.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tracee-ellis-ross-in-girlfriends-2000-to-2008></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tracee Ellis Ross in "Girlfriends," 2000 to 2008</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the early '00s marked a period of silky straight styles and relaxers, Joan Carol Clayton, an attorney at Goldberg, Swedelson, McDonald, and Lee, a prestigious L.A. lawfirm, proved that natural hair belonged in the workplace. But career aside, Tracee Ellis Ross' beloved character did not only wear her hair in perfectly defined curls. Several scenes showcased Joan's hair in a frizzy, ready-for-wash-day state, making her all the more relatable for Black women watching at home.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nathalie-emmanuel-in-game-of-thrones-2011-to-2019></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Nathalie Emmanuel in "Game of Thrones," 2011 to 2019</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>HBO</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Seeing a Black woman in a fantasy show, taking place during Medieval times, with her natural hair out in full display is not something we see on television very often. So while some may say Nathalie Emmanuel character Missandei only played a minor role in the series, it was major for us.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-viola-davis-in-how-to-get-away-with-murder-2014-to-2020></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Viola Davis in "How to Get Away With Murder," 2014 to 2020</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There was truly no better pairing for this scene than Viola Davis, who played Annalise Keating, and the great Cicely Tyson, who performed as her mother. During this episode, Annalise falls apart emotionally, and looks for comfort by going back to a childhood ritual Black women know so well: sitting between her mother's knees and letting her mom comb her hair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-issa-rae-in-insecure-2016-to-present></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Issa Rae in "Insecure," 2016 to Present</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>HBO</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While most natural textures have been both accepted and embraced, 4C hair still gets labeled as "unmanageable," "bad," "ugly," and a whole slew of negative attributes. However, working with hairstylist Felicia Leatherwood, Issa Rae, who plays Issa Dee on the show, has single-handedly shown the world just how versatile and beautiful this coily texture is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2eRobluusCtrKuZnGS7osDUq5ilZZiWtrN50Z6nq52jmru1rdOipqdlpKt6rrvVopys</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnatural-hair-representation-tv-movies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnatural-hair-representation-tv-movies.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnatural-hair-representation-tv-movies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnatural-hair-representation-tv-movies.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnatural-hair-representation-tv-movies.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnatural-hair-representation-tv-movies.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ariana-grande-shawn-mendes-logic-with-ryan-tedder-set-to-perform-at-the-2018-vmas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ariana-grande-shawn-mendes-logic-with-ryan-tedder-set-to-perform-at-the-2018-vmas.html>Ariana Grande, Shawn Mendes &amp;amp; Logic With Ryan Tedder Set To Perform At The 2018 VMAs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./paris-hilton-ring-bm.html>Loved-up Paris Hilton wears her heart on her ring finger</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./paris-hilton-ring-bm.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
