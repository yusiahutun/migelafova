It is not rocket <a href=#>science</a> to tell if one party in the relationship is no longer interested. What is challenging is understanding the accuracy of these signs and whether they are reflective of what the other party is feeling.

Here are some signs to watch out for.</p><h2>How to tell if your baby mama still loves you</h2><p class=align-left>The most asked question is whether or not the baby changes anything in the relationship, and the answer is a definite "Yes." However, some changes arise, especially on the side of the lady. It gets complicated when the previous gestures of love or affection are replaced by sideshows and conflict. To ascertain if your baby mama still wants you, here are some signs to watch out for:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/62b6a01e01ca7373.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ funny artistic quotes and sayings that will make you laugh</span></p></a><h3>1. She starts calling you more often</h3><p class=align-left>The essence of having a relationship in the first place is to have healthy communication and companionship. When the conversation gets dim after some time, then there is a problem and trouble is brewing. However, when your baby mama calls to check on you more often than before, that is a sign that she still wants you.</p><h3>2. Starts acknowledging you as her baby daddy</h3><p class=align-left>Some signs are too obvious to associate with sincere affection. However, the reality is that appreciating him and admitting that "he is my baby daddy" among others means a bid deal. When she respects you and appreciates your effort, the love candle gets livelier and shines brighter.</p><h3>3. She starts asking for more time with you</h3><p class=align-left>If she asks you to stay around a little bit longer, then it is evident that your child's mother still loves you. Distance is the biggest enemy when in a fight, and has been translated as the widening of a wedge. However, you can join the dots when she wants you around more than usual and respond to her signals effectively.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/179a71272e2b2899.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ save the date quotes for a wedding: Best, funny, and cute ideas</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5d144060b62a15a8.jpg><h3>4. She starts being possessive</h3><p class=align-left>When your baby mama starts gaining more interests, the first behaviour change is that she will begin being possessive and want you to only sing her tune. If you guys had fought for some time to the extent of pulling the trigger, then it's time to get back with your baby mama. At times she may not be able to say it, but this is a sign that she wants and loves you.</p><h3>5. When she starts to leave "I love you" messages</h3><p class=align-left>When she starts confessing the worlds of love in texts through your WhatsApp and other chat platforms, there is no other proof to wait for. Even if the last time you guys shared the <a href=#>sweet words</a>, "I Love You" was a long time ago, you ought to understand that she is confessing her affection when you notice a change in her communication.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f7e69dadcf886282.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to impress a girl on Instagram chat (with examples)</span></p></a><h2>Signs of a jealous baby mama</h2><p class=align-left>In other instances, some actions show your baby mama is crazy about you to the point of developing jealousy. While most people will misinterpret this as a clingy and too demanding, it means she wants you for herself and herself alone. Here are signs that will tell you she is jealous:</p><h3>1. Loses her cool whenever she sees you texting</h3><p class=align-left>Well, ladies can be too possessive of what they believe is theirs. She will sense danger whenever she feels that your love for her is exchanging hands with another woman. Sometimes, these feelings are not founded on anything tangible, but the fact that her instincts sense danger, she will fight back.</p><h3>2. She starts to get annoyed by some of your behaviours</h3><p class=align-left>Some of the behaviors she will feel uncomfortable about include coming it the house late or disliking some of the posts on your social media. Well, it is not that she doesn't like you being in your best, but she can't take the fact that someone else may spot you outside there.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a239dc286ab513a6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 powerful prayers to mend what is broken in your life</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/62b6a01e01ca7373.jpg><h3>3. Starts questioning about some of your friends and their intentions</h3><p class=align-left>The extent of jealousy for baby mamas is farfetched. Even though she knows your friends from long ago comprising of both gents and ladies, these people start becoming a bother to her if they are taking any additional attention that could be channelled to her. Do not be surprised when she asks you about your whereabouts with your friends. It only means she is jealous.</p><h3>4. Starts calling you irregularly</h3><p class=align-left>We mentioned that her calling you is a sign that she wants you back. However, she may flip to the extreme side of things and start making calls for reasons not justifiable. For instance, she may call you on short intervals while at work or away on official duty to confirm that you are there and not some other place with someone else's.</p><h3>5. She starts demanding extras of everything from you</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bfb52626ba1beb41.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to make your angry girlfriend happy over text in 10 ways</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You may have devoted just enough time to share with her and still manage to attend to other things like work. However, if she starts asking about your work hours, more time over the weekends, and more compliments whenever she does anything small, then this is a sign that she is super jealous.</p><h2>Signs your baby mama wants you back</h2><p class=align-left>After breaking up, most couples tend to hang around for some time while others opt to move on. However, you should be able to read signs or pointers that indicate your baby mama may not just be over you yet and wants the father of her child back. Here are some signs to watch out for:</p><h3>1. She is more comfortable when around you</h3><p class=align-left>You will notice a sudden change in the way she behaves around you or when you visit. Unlike when it was tensed, and she looked stiff after the breakup, this time she will even suggest things you wouldn't envision between the two of you ever again.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9fffd8b70b06499c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 different types of girls you'll meet and their personalities</span></p></a><h3>2. She talks about how amazing you are</h3><p class=align-left>She will start sounding like she is seeing you for the first time and cannot lay her eyes off you. She will begin to compliment you whenever you do something small or any effort you apply. If you are interested, this is the time you can get your baby mama to fall in love with you all over again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/179a71272e2b2899.jpg><h3>3. She still refers to herself as part of you</h3><p class=align-left>After breaking up, you guys could have parted ways angry and unhappy. However, do not be surprised when you notice some unexpected behaviours from your baby mama. She may start suggesting ideas like going to meet your <a href=#>family</a> and friends. For instance, if she asks to accompany you to your sister's graduation or a family event, then it is clear she still wants you back.</p><h3>4. She reminds you of the good times you had together</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9efbce286f77d96e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 funniest libra memes that perfectly describe this zodiac sign</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Nostalgia is the best way to rekindle a dying romance. Your baby mama may resort to this weapon as a way of luring you back to be with her. There are moments you too appreciate about the two of you, which may well suggest to you that it is time to reconsider your options about her.</p><h3>5. She suddenly starts being your closest friend</h3><p class=align-left>It is a rare thing for someone who once hated you for ruining her life to start getting closer and getting more concerned about your affairs. Well, this is not a wonder but a sign of renewed interest and affection from your baby mama. Whenever you spot any unusual closeness or compliments from her friends, then it's a sign that she wants you back again.</p><h3>6. Her friends become more indulged and concerned about you</h3><p class=align-left>Most times, when she leaves, her friends also cut back any relations they had with you. However, some gestures are too good to be true, especially when the friends to your baby mama start getting closer to you. They will leave you messages or tell you how your baby mama is doing as a way of getting your attention redirected to her. It is a sign that she wants you back, and is just using her friends as the gateway, especially if you were in good terms with them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d4a98aef316017a2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How does a man feel when a woman walks away? 15 different ways</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is sometimes difficult to know whether someone still loves you, especially after you broke up for reasons so serious such as a child.
