If they fall short of proteins and moisture, then you have to deal with issues like dry cuticles, thin, and brittle nails, etc. So, to prevent any type of nail damage, we have brought to you the best nail moisturizers. These moisturizers not only take good care of your nail plate, nail bed, and primarily cuticles but also promote healthy growth.</p><p>The water and lipid content of your nails is low, as compared to your skin’s stratum corneum. However, nails are extremely permeable to water. When the water content of your nails increases, they become opaque and soft. On the contrary, when there is a decrease in the water content, nails tend to become brittle and dry. Hence, adequate and proper nail moisturization is vital to prevent your nails from becoming brittle (<a href=#><u>1</u></a>). Dermatologists at the American Academy of Dermatology Association recommend applying a moisturizing nail care product like petroleum jelly to the cuticles and nails multiple times a day. This practice minimizes the brittleness of your nails and aids in preventing your nails from chipping.</p><p>Speaking of the impact of a nail moisturizer, our contributor Anna Parvatova, Creative Director for SNS Nails, says, “Our cuticles are very delicate and prone to damage. Plus, our nails are naturally dry and brittle due to their low oil and moisture content. Using a nail moisturizer on these areas multiple times per day can help keep such dry areas hydrated, healthy, and nourished. Well-hydrated cuticles and nails can promote nail growth too, so a moisturizer can be really beneficial in the long run.”</p><p>Our list of the 12&nbsp;best nail moisturizers contains cuticle oils, nail creams, and balms.
