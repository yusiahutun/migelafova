And it seems like there’s more than one woman who accused the former Voice judge of infidelity.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Adam and Behati</a> married in July 2014 after almost <a href=# rel=noopener>two years of dating</a>. They welcomed their first child, a daughter named Dusty Rose, in 2016. Their second child, a daughter named Gio Grace, was born in 2018. News broke that <a href=# rel=noopener>Adam and Behati</a> were expecting their third child together after the Victoria’s Secret model was photographed with a baby bump in Santa Barbara, California, in September 2022. Days later, Behati confirmed the news with an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram photo</a> of her and her baby bump. “Recent,” she captioned the post.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/adam-levine-blake-shelton-leave-the-voice.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/behati-prinsloo-adam-levine.jpg><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in November 2021, Behati revealed that she wants five children with Adam. “We always knew we wanted a second one,” she said at the time. “So I think for me … when I had two babies under the age of 2, I was just like, ‘Don’t even think about it!’ I do also want five kids. But don’t even think about it.” She continued, “Never say never. We want a big family. Who knows? We’re leaving it up to fate and just what happens. What will happen, will happen. So there are no limits to it.” Behati also confirmed to Entertainment Tonight at the time that she and Adam were thinking of having a third child.&nbsp;“I think it’s just kind of where we are in our life. And with COVID too, I was just seeing [my daughters] together, like, ‘Maybe we should have a third just to have more kids.’ Because it was so sweet to see [them together]. But then, I don’t know. Never say never,” she said.</p><p>Three days after Adam and Behati announced their pregnancy, however, rumors sparked that the former Voice judge had cheated on his wife with an Instagram model. So…did <a href=# rel=noopener>Adam Levine cheat on Behati Prinsloo</a>? Read on for what we know about <a href=# id=auto-tag_adam-levine data-tag=adam-levine>Adam Levine</a>‘s cheating rumors and multiple women have said about his infidelity.</p><h2>Did Adam Levine cheat on Behati Prinsloo?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Adam-Levine-Behati-Prinsloo.jpg><p>Did Adam Levine cheat on <a href=# id=auto-tag_behati-prinsloo data-tag=behati-prinsloo>Behati Prinsloo</a>? Three days after Behati announced her pregnancy, Instagram model Sumner Stroh posted a TikTok video, in which she claimed she had an affair with Adam and he asked to name his baby after her. “Essentially, I was having an affair with a man who is married to a Victoria’s Secret model,” Sumner said. “At the time, I was young, I was naive. Quite frankly, I feel exploited. I wasn’t in the scene like I am now, so I was definitely very easily manipulated.”</p><p>Sumner then shared a screenshot of direct messages between her and Adam. “Seeing u in person I was like…I’m fucked,” Sumner wrote to Adam, who responded, “You are 50 times hotter in person. And so am I.” Sumner continued in the TikTok, “Adam and I were seeing each other for about a year. After I stopped talking to him over a period of months, this is how he came into my life.”</p><p>Sumner shared another screenshot of a direct message from Adam in which he asked if he and Behati could name their third child after her. “Ok serious question. I’m having another baby and if it’s w boy I really wanna name it Sumner. You ok with that? DEAD serious,” Adam wrote. Sumner continued in the TikTok, “I was like, ‘I’m in hell. I have to be in hell at this point.’ My morals were unknowingly compromised. I was completely manipulated.”</p><p>Sumner then explained why she went public with her story. “I wanted to deal with this privately. I never wanted to come forward because obviously I know the implications in doing what I do, making money the way I do and being an Instagram model, so being tied to a story like this, I know the stereotypes,” she said. “I had sent some screenshots to some friends I thought I trusted and one of them had attempted to sell to a tabloid. So here I am.” Sumner captioned the TikTok, “embarrassed I was involved w a man with this utter lack of remorse and respect.”</p><a title=@sumnerstroh href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@sumnerstroh</a> embarrassed I was involved w a man with this utter lack of remorse and respect. <a title=greenscreen href=# rel="noopener nofollow">#greenscreen</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Sumner Stroh" href=# rel="noopener nofollow">♬ original sound – Sumner Stroh</a><p>After she posted the TikTok, Sumner wrote on her Instagram Story: “Aware many people will try to fill in the gaps with many false assumptions. I don’t feel like I’m doing any favors, considering the manner this had to go about. It’s a lot to digest but hopefully, at the very least, the truth being out can do some good.”</p><p>Comedian Maryka also accused Adam of cheating on Behati in a series of Instagram Stories on September 20, 2022, where she shared flirty messages and videos between her and the Maroon 5 singer. “Don’t ever apologize for being human,” Adam wrote in a message to Maryka, who responded, “Ahahah but I didn’t. I will definitely take some time off ig though.” Adam wrote back, “Distract yourself by fucking with me! He also sent Maryka a video in which he said, “I’m stupid.” Some messages also include timestamps fromJuly 2022, which is when Adam celebrated his eighth wedding anniversary to Behati.</p><p>In another message in July 2022, Adam tells Maryka, “I’m now obsessed with you.” Maryka responds, “Dude aren’t you like married lol.” Adam wrote back that he is but “it’s a bit complicated.” He added, ‘Stuff gets hard and the vid thing didn’t help. I might get away.” In another message, Adam tells Maryka, “Holy fuck. Holy fucking fuck. That body of yours is absurd,” to which Maryka responds, “Next date I’ll be like ‘do you wanna make out with the devil?'” Adam writes back, “Haha. How are you such an hourglass. My god. Seriously fuuuuck.” Maryka then sent a photo of herself to Adam, which he liked and responded with, “I may need to see the booty. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.” Maryka wrote back, “No booty.” Adam responded, “Watching your ass jiggle on that table will permanently scar me but otherwise I’m amazing.” He added, “Fuuuuuuck. I’d do anything for it.” When Maryka laughed at his response, Adam wrote back, “I’d buy it steak dinner and whisper sweet nothings into it. I wanna tattoo my ass now. Nate may come to Maui and tattoo me and surf. I need to put some clouds behind the reaper.”</p><p>In another message in June 2022, Adam told Maryka that he and Behati are expecting a third child, a son they plan to name Zea. “That is so fucking weird when you said you were tired I was going to say maybe mercury in retrograde but I never said it. Trippy,” Adam wrote to Maryka, who responded, “No fucking way.” He wrote back, “That shit is weird haha,” to which Maryka responded, “Damn. I’m a qquarius and shit’s getting very weird lately.” Adam then wrote, “Fuckin hell. I’m having another baby. Wifey is pregnant! And I’m having a BOY. And I’m naming him Zea. He will be a bad ass.”</p><p>After the Sumner and Maryka’s claims, Adam’s former yoga instructor, Alanna Zabel, who trained him from 2007 to 2010, also accused him of sending flirty messages in an Instagram Story on September 21, 2022. “Long overdue #ExposeAdamLevine. I was his yoga instructor for a few years from 2007 to 2010. He often said that he told his friends that his yoga instructor had the best ass in town and it was cute,” Alanna wrote. “One day he texted me saying, ‘I want to spend the day with you naked.’ I was in the bath but my jealous ex saw it and went into a rate. I assured my ex that I was sure it was meant for Adam’s then girlfriend, Becky, and was a mistake.”</p><p>She continued, “I texted Adam to ask if that was the case. Adam didn’t reply … and my ex became violent, breaking my wrist. Massive life changing, destructive moment, and when I told Adam he ignored it, never apologized, removed me from of the upcoming tour and iced me out during one of the most devastating times of my life all from his one flirtatious text.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Cosmopolitan</a> in 2009, three years before he started dating Behati, Adam confessed that he had cheated in past relationships because he didn’t believe monogamy was in his “genetic makeup.” “Instinctively, monogamy is not in our genetic makeup. People cheat. I have cheated. And you know what? There is nothing worse than the feeling of doing it,” he said at the time.</p><h2>What was Adam Levine’s response to rumors he cheated on Behati Prinsloo?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Adam-Levine-Behati-Prinsloo.jpg><p>What was Adam Levine’s response to rumors he cheated on Behati Prinsloo? After Sumner’s TikTok, Adam issued a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>, where he denied he had an “affair” with Sumner but took “full responsibility” of his inappropriate behavior with her. “I used poor judgment in speaking with anyone other than my wife in ANY kind of flirtatious manner. I did not have an affair, nevertheless, I crossed the line during a regrettable period of my life,” his statement read. “In certain instances it became inappropriate. I have addressed that and taken proactive steps to remedy this with my family.”</p><p>He continued, “My wife and my family is all I care about in this world. To be this naive and stupid enough to risk the only thing that truly matters to me was the greatest mistake I could ever make. I will never make it again. I take full responsibility. We will get through it and we will get through it together.”</p><p>A source confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> on September 21, 2022, that “nothing physical happened” between Adam and Sumner.&nbsp; “Nothing physical happened. He swears it,” the insider said. “He was messaging her, being flirtatious with three women. One of them — she specifically said they have a physical relationship but he is completely denying that to friends.” The source also explained that Adam messaged women outside of his marriage because he craves “female attention.” “Why would he do this? He liked the attention,” the insider said. “He likes it more than most.” The source also claimed that Adam started messaging women more “during COVID-19” when he was isolated, though he and Behati were still together. “[They] definitely didn’t break up and they weren’t on a break,” the insider said.</p><p>The source also called Adam’s request to name his and Behati’s third child “Sumner” showed “very bad judgement” on the Maroon 5 singer’s part. “People don’t know what he was thinking,” the insider said.</p><p>On March 23, 2023, a source told<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Us Weekly</a> that Adam fully devotes his life to his own family after the scandal. “Adam has done a complete turnaround in how he handles his marriage,” the insider said. “He basically recommitted himself 100 percent to Behati and his family.” According to the source, he “realized he made a huge mistake” by talking to other women and refocused on his wife. The source detailed of how the family bonded. “They’re spending more quality time together, date nights without the kids and girls only nights for Behati,” and noted that fans might have been “seeing them out and about more.” The source added, “Adam also got back to basics [doing] yoga and meditation, and just got his priorities straight.”</p><h2>What was Behati Prinsloo’s response to rumors Adam Levine cheated on her?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Adam-Levine-Behati-Prinsloo.jpg><p>What was Behati Prinsloo’s response to rumors Adam Levine cheated on her?
