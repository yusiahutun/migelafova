my childhood home went on the market and there's been a lot of attention and questions about this new listing,' she said before adding that there were many 'happy memories' attached to the home.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With 16 bedrooms, 13 bathrooms and 12 half-baths, the mansion puts country clubs to shame and even comes complete with its very own outdoor pool, four tennis courts, nine-hole golf course, bowling alley, arcade, basketball court, and indoor water park.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Speaking of the bowling alley, Kylie said: 'It was once in a blue moon that we would use it, whether it was with friends or my sister and I would rally our parents to play.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And since the home was spread across eight structures, she added: 'Golf carts were our main mode of transportation, I was driving a golf cart at age five by myself.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Because the property was so big and smartphones weren't as widely used when I was younger, we had a paging system across the whole property so if you needed someone you would just page them and everyone would hear it.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The indoor water pool or water park as many called it, was said to be the most jaw-dropping area of the home and the daughter noted that it became a hot spot for parties, including her The Little Mermaid themed fourth birthday party.&nbsp;</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li
