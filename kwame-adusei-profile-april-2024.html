Without naming names, he adds, “I’m sure you know a lot of brands like that—they just design it based on the fact that it [looks] really cool…because that’s what happens all the time, right?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s no denying the pieces constructed by the Ghanaian designer do look cool. In fact, his chic habiliments have caught the attention of many of today’s Hollywood It girls, from Kylie Jenner and singer-songwriter Kali Uchis to Ciara and Lori Harvey—all of whom have worn Kwame Adusei pieces on social media, red carpets, and elsewhere. What likely draws these celebrities to the designs, though, is not just that they’re undeniably unique, but also that they’re made to last.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“For me, sustainability is having a peace for forever,” Adusei says. It’s a sentiment that may sound simple, but still feels revolutionary when so many garments continue to end up in landfills—something Adusei knows all too well, given that he grew up seeing junk piles around his hometown. “If you see those kids from the National Geographic channel that were just playing on a landfill with no shirt on—yeah, that was me,” he says frankly. “But don’t get me wrong; I’m not selling a sad story.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Adusei’s story is actually one of serendipity and communion. Despite a fascination with clothing trends throughout his childhood, the visionary didn’t intend to enter the industry—at least not on the design side. While he had dreams of becoming a basketball player, he first tried to make it as a model. Then one year, after he’d started a fundraiser to provide new clothes to a local orphanage, he found himself falling in love with fashion design.</p><img alt="kwame adusei wearing a hat" title="Kwame Adusei Studio Photo" width=2279 height=1541 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tati995-029-65f0b8b0aec75.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kwame Adusei</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Before he knew it, he was designing clothes for the people who would forever be his toughest critics: his sisters. “They [were] like, ‘Who’s going to wear this? This is ugly,’” he humorously recounts. And while that might sound harsh, Adusei says, these critiques shaped him and helped improve his work, teaching him what design was really about: “For a fashion line to be successful, you need that skinny cousin, you need that curvy niece, you know, and you need to make clothes for all of them.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Adusei unveiled his first label, Ćharlotte Privé, in the early 2010s, before eventually launching his namesake brand in 2022. Now, nearly 15 years into his career, he doesn’t just want to make clothes that people keep—he wants to make clothes that buyers will struggle to ever part with. Shoppers, the designer says, should want to wear pieces until they can see holes in them. “It’s like you love it so much that you can’t even get rid of it even if you wanted to,” he says.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Funnily enough, many of Adusei’s designs already come with holes—large slits and cutouts, or unusual lines of buttons that allow the wearer to bare their navel or back. There’s a subtle sexiness to his designs, because they bridge the gap between something you might wear to the office and something you might wear on a night out with friends. He clearly enjoys breaking the rules and blurring the strict categories of fashion, and the result is thrilling.</p><img alt="a person in a dress" title="Kwame Adusei clothing" width=1680 height=2100 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/10-22-kwame-backstage-shanelle-infante-133-6610463849f70.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kwame Adusei</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Take a glance through the Kwame Adusei store and you’ll find blazers with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://kwameadusei.com/collections/tops/products/kafra-top-1 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="slouchy oversize cuts" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">slouchy oversize cuts</a> and soft patterns that make them look like comfy flannels you toss on after rolling out of bed. He gives his sweatpants a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://kwameadusei.com/collections/bottoms/products/kalo-sweatpants data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wide-legged bottom hem" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">wide-legged bottom hem</a> that would indicate they were sharp dress slacks if you didn’t glance twice. And what might begin as a breezy beach button-up becomes a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://kwameadusei.com/collections/dresses/products/kala-dress-1 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dynamic knotted minidress" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">dynamic knotted minidress</a> once Kwame is done with it. Oh, and did I mention the pieces are made with deadstock fabrics?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This unusual approach is quite different from the pieces Adusei made for Ćharlotte Privé, a brand characterized by flowing frocks and eye-popping colors and patterns. His artistic pivot can be traced back to March 2020, when he moved to Los Angeles mere weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic struck.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As he sought out an aesthetic change, Adusei began studying the trends he observed throughout the city (before everyone started hiding inside, that is). Almost immediately, he recognized that comfort was prevalent, but it manifested differently in the United States than it did in Ghana. “If you didn’t grow up in the U.S., you wouldn’t find sweatpants the most comfortable thing to wear,” he notes. Yet all over the streets of L.A., he noticed these staples in droves (along with plenty of boyfriend jeans, too).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Besides the American focus on comfort, he also recognized that curvy folks, especially women, weren’t being seen or catered to. “What happens is, they just end up buying like an oversize male cut, and [they] just adjust it to suit the body, especially in L.A.,” Adusei says. As someone who hadn’t originally been designing for Western shoppers, this stuck out to him. “We see most brands only cater for the European body, right? … But because I was born and raised in Ghana, my only form of inspiration or reference is the curves.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ultimately, Adusei made it his mission to design clothes that would be comfortable, while also being adaptable to different body types, which meant some radical design choices down the line. “I don’t put seams in my clothing,” he says. “Most of the clothing doesn’t have side seams, especially our pants.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s true that if you study the Kwame Adusei collections closely, you’ll find very few stitches that constrict the wearer. Instead, the organic silhouettes hug bodies like a second skin—willing to stretch and shrink with the wearer easily. This is another aspect that makes Adusei’s pieces hold up over time, and the seeds of these designs hearken back to his birthplace. “I began to understand why I never liked seams,” he says with a laugh. “When you look at our traditional garments from Ghana, like our ceremonial outfits, it’s very much draped, we drape the cloth of fabric—that’s how we express ourselves. So, I ended up gravitating towards something that I didn’t really pay attention to while I was in Ghana.”</p><img alt="ciara at 2023 recording academy honors presented by the black music collective" title="2023 Recording Academy Honors Presented By The Black Music Collective - Arrivals" width=2264 height=3397 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ciara-attends-the-recording-academy-honors-presented-by-the-news-photo-1712342674.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kayla Oaddams</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another important feature that Adusei pulls from Ghanaian fashion is androgyny, which he explains is typical in West African clothing. In fact, the word even makes its way into his label’s mission statement, which says the brand is “a culmination of West African roots translated to a global audience with a perspective founded in androgyny, sophistication, and sexuality.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To be fair, you will find a separate tab for men’s clothing on the website, but if you pay attention, you’ll see the gender presentation of the models switches up no matter what section you’re scrolling through. With this effort, Adusei is trying to make his pieces approachable to any shopper, and make them feel free to try something new. “The way we’re putting out the pieces, we’re trying to find a very subtle yet very approachable way to just get everybody to be excited about fashion, rather than [thinking of it as] male/female clothing,” he says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With the arrival of the Kwame Adusei pre–Spring/Summer ’24 collection, which just went live on April 4, the man at the helm of the brand is continuing his radical vision, and it feels fitting this line has arrived at the start of Earth Month.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of the most striking things Adusei says to me is when I bring up his dedication to sustainability. Upon hearing that term, he says: “Personally, I don’t think it should be a selling point. I think it should just be something that you do as a human. Like, we are trying to make sure that we’re on this earth and we leave it better than how we entered it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With that, and with his designs, Adusei leaves me thinking of a hopeful future for fashion, one in which articles of clothing are like pieces of antique furniture in our homes: treasures we value and care for our entire lives, potentially passing along to others; things we slowly collect over time to make a statement about who we are (and look damn good while doing it). As the designer himself simply puts it: “Fashion is love.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/04e4fe03-f532-4e6a-8cd4-455131aa4449_1702400410.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Joel Calfee" title="Headshot of Joel Calfee" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Joel is the editorial and social media assistant for HarpersBAZAAR.com, where he covers all things celebrity news.
