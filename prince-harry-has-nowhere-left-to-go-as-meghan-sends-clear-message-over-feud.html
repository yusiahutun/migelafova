Sadly, it doesn’t look like it’s going to be healed anytime soon. One columnist claims <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> has been left in the lurch as he tries to move on with his family in California while ties back in the UK grow weaker. There’s also reports <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>‘s absences when the Duke travels back overseas is also not helping the situation. Jan Moir, from the Daily Mail, has said <a href=#>Meghan absences next to Prince Harry</a> in many of his trips back to the UK sends a ‘clear message’.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-s-royal-rift-needs-meghan-to-heal>Prince Harry’s royal rift ‘needs Meghan’ to heal</h2><p>It comes after the 38-year-old has stepped back onto British soil multiple times without the Duchess of Sussex holding his hand.</p><p>Rumors say Harry, brother to <a href=#>Prince William</a>, will be back for a few days ahead of the Invictus Games in a couple of weeks. It’s believed it could become an opportune moment for the <a href=#>dad-of-two to have ‘peace talks’ with his father King Charles</a>.</p><p>He’s set to attend the WellChild <a href=#>award show</a> ceremony. It is taking place on the eve of the first anniversary of the Queen’s death. The royal duo pulled out of appearing in 2022. This was as Harry received news his grandmother, <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, was gravely ill. Sadly, the monarch passed away. However, apart from the funeral, Meghan hasn’t returned. She was absent during the coronation of King Charles and <a href=#>Queen Consort Camilla</a>. The Duchess also didn’t fly back to support Harry in person during his emotional civil case against the Mirror publishers.</p><p>Moir <a href=# rel=nofollow>wrote</a>: “The message from Meghan couldn’t be clearer. She is never going to set foot in the grey, cake-filled, miserable UK again if she can possibly help it.”</p><p>“Perhaps being forbidden to attend the Queen’s deathbed at Balmoral — to shed light, to empower, to recommend a turmeric cleanse and some yoga stretches to the woman she never knew as Gan-Gan — was the last straw. And if there is a role for her as wifely appeaser to help heal the rift between her husband and his family, she has chosen to avoid that, too. As is her right.</p><p>But there is a puzzling disconnect about all this bitter friction.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-forbidden-to-fly-to-balmoral>Meghan ‘forbidden’ to fly to Balmoral</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-970332212-1024x660.jpg><p>Sources claimed there was a frantic 30 minutes before he departed. It was when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex prepared to visit the Queen after she turned ill. On September 8 last year, it’s been claimed <a href=#>King Charles</a> made a call. He allegedly told his son not to bring the mom-of-two to Balmoral. This was when the royals rushed to the bedside of the monarch.</p><p>Although fortunate the couple were there when the Queen took a turn, only the Duke made the trip in her final hours.</p><p>The Sun <a href=# rel=nofollow>reported</a> Harry was at Frogmore Cottage – where he and Meghan lived as newlyweds – when he received a call from Charles. The insider alleged it was the now-monarch to said it wasn’t “right or appropriate” for the former <a href=#>TV</a> star to come with him.</p><p>They added: “It was pointed out to him that Kate was not going and that the numbers really should be limited to the very closest family.&nbsp;</p><p>“Charles made it very, very clear Meghan would not be welcome.”</p><p>William arrived before Harry, and <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> was not as his side either.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bombshell-interviews-and-a-memoir>Bombshell interviews and a memoir</h2><p>It came after a year of bombshell allegations from the Sussexes. The duo stepped down as senior royals in 2020. The following year, they sat down with a tell-all interview with <a href=#>celebrity</a> neighbor Oprah Winfrey. After, the Duke claimed his father and brother were trapped in royal duties in an Apple documentary.</p><p>Next, their hit <a href=#>Netflix</a> docuseries, Harry & Meghan, opened up more royal wounds. Then in January 2023, he released his explosive memoir Spare. The brothers’ fighting, allegations of leaks to the press and no support for the young couple, have caused tension within The Firm, sources say.</p><p>Now Harry is seemingly travelling back to the UK, he has “nowhere to go,” Moir explains.</p><p>But she warns the claims of severed ties with his family may come at a cost.</p><p>She adds: “Prince Harry is coming home, but there is nowhere for him to go. His involvement in the Invictus Games and charities such as WellChild is the very best of him. But surely the day will soon dawn when he comes to regret losing what he says he prizes the most: his family.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlwX2h%2BcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2Gafmqtdo7y4tMSrnGaklZvBbsDOZp6oZZGoeq6xxqGYp2Wjmrulv4yco56ZomK6pr%2FSmp6eZZ%2BrsrN5xZ6snWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-harry-has-nowhere-left-to-go-as-meghan-sends-clear-message-over-feud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fprince-harry-has-nowhere-left-to-go-as-meghan-sends-clear-message-over-feud.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fprince-harry-has-nowhere-left-to-go-as-meghan-sends-clear-message-over-feud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fprince-harry-has-nowhere-left-to-go-as-meghan-sends-clear-message-over-feud.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-harry-has-nowhere-left-to-go-as-meghan-sends-clear-message-over-feud.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harry-has-nowhere-left-to-go-as-meghan-sends-clear-message-over-feud.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./heather-lynn-hodgins-kidd.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./heather-lynn-hodgins-kidd.html>Who is Heather Lynn Hodgins Kidd dating?
