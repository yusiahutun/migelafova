Season 7 premiered on August 16 and followed 30-plus<a href=# rel=noopener> Bachelor and Bachelorette alums</a> as they looked for love in Mexico. The season, which is the first to air since season 6 in 2019 due to the current health crisis, was filmed over the course of three weeks at the Playa Escondida resort in Sayulita, Mexico, in June 2021.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>In an interview with StyleCaster in October 2020,&nbsp; former host <a href=# rel=noopener>Chris Harrison</a> revealed that there had been talks to film <a href=# rel=noopener>Bachelor in Paradise in 2020</a>, but those plans were put on hold to focus on <a href=# rel=noopener>The Bachelorette season 16</a>, which aired months behind schedule.</p><p>“Early on, we thought, ‘Hey. If this only lasts a couple weeks, we could still cram The Bachelorette in all in and make it all work and push Bachelor in Paradise,’” Harrison said at the time. “Quickly, we realized this is a much bigger problem and everything was going to have to take a back seat. We thought we might be lucky to just get The Bachelorette done. We realized Bachelor in Paradise was just going to go away for the summer. Unfortunately. It was just a casualty of this pandemic. Now we’re going to get into Matt James doing The Bachelor. That will put us back on schedule and hopefully, knock on wood, next summer, things will open. We’ll have the vaccine and we can get back to our regular calendar.”</p><p>As for what to expect this season of Bachelor in Paradise, bartender Wells Adams told Us Weekly in July that fans can expect a lot of romance and a lot of drama. “There’s love, there’s romance. There’s a lot of drama, you know, it’s got everything,” he said. &nbsp;“The drinks are bad, the advice is worse, but the bar is open. … There are some twists and turns that I was shocked by, and I never thought would ever happen on the show. And I think people are really, really going to love this season.”</p><p>During an episode of his podcast, “Bachelor Happy Hour,” in July, Wells also teased that something that he’s never seen in his five seasons he’s been on Bachelor in Paradise happens in season 7. “Of all the five seasons I’ve done in Paradise, the craziest stuff happens on this season. I think no one is going to expect what happens,” he said. “What happens this season is insane.” Guest host Tituss Burgess also teased that Bachelor in Paradise season 7 isn’t short of the drama. “Honestly for me, all I had to do was keep my ear to the ground and listen for what was happening, the drama, the love triangles, all of it. It kind of does the job for you,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight.</a> “You zoom out and then you figure out, well, we need a party here. We need a date night here. We need to mix this up and see just how serious this person is about the other person.”</p><p>And for those who have watched past Bachelor in Paradise seasons, Joe Amabile, who was on Bachelor in Paradise season 5 and returned for season 7, told the “Click Bait” podcast July that the current season is more “insane” and “intense” than his first. “I wasn’t expecting to be original cast,” he said. “I forgot all of what Paradise is about and it is a wild ride, and this season is insane. It really is. … It almost was, like, every day got more and more intense.” He continued, “It was a lot different than my first time. It was wild.”</p><p>As for those who wonder how much Bachelor in Paradise is real, guest host Lance Bass told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in August that the drama is very, very real. “I was surprised to see how real everything was, because, you know, those shows can probably get very heavily produced,” he said. “[I thought,] ‘They’ve been on the franchise before, it’s like they come in kind of like actors.’ Like, ‘OK, I know what y’all need. Let’s do this.’”</p><p>How much drama is there, you ask?
