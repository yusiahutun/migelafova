Chris Botti is a renowned trumpeter and composer, and today, we will be talking about his winning repertoire to Orchestra followed by his married life and dating history.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>The Minneapolis Tour:</h2><p>On November 18, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Friday night at the Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis</a>, Chris Botti helped on getting most of the seats get occupied with his music and as we say it in a metaphorically, ‘killed the show.' Botti presented a 90 minutes performance; a dramatic crystalline rendition of ‘Concierto de Aranjuez’ by Spanish composer Joaquin Rodrigo.</p><p>In addition to that iconic piece of music, he played one of his hit ballads which after some notes, Botti fans instantaneously recognized. The mix quickly followed&nbsp;brassy midrange riffs over a funky electric tune showcasing the group’s drummer, Lee Pearson.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>The 54 years old also honored Leonard Cohen, a singer-songwriter who recently departed by playing Cohen’s signature piece “Hallelujah” while spotlighting guitarist Ben Butler.</p><p><strong>Caption:&nbsp;Chris Botti Concert, Nov 2016 - Minneapolis</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Chris Botti: Dating? Married?</h2><p>The Grammy Award-winning trumpeter as we know is not a married man and surely, does not have a wife, but amid of his busy schedule and all the tour hours, he did take the time to date some women. In 2012, <a href=# rel=follow>Brandi Glanville from Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> revealed that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she dated Chris Botti</a>&nbsp;and they didn't sleep together but did have a fun time. She said,</p><p>“Clearly her misinformation wasn't taken to heart because I did eventually have a date with the handsome Chris Botti, and NO we didn't sleep together, but we did have a super sexy fun time. Sadly for me he is always traveling or working, but we do keep in touch and are friends.”</p><p>&nbsp;Moving on from Brandi Glanville, Chris Botti also dated <a href=# rel=follow>Katie Couric</a> &nbsp;few years back, but again his tours and shows came in the way. Chris revealed that he remains good friends with her and also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed how he cannot have relationships</a>; not because he is a gay man or anything else but because of his work.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><img alt height=533 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/Chris%20Botti%20with%20Katie%20Couric%20at%20a%20basketball.jpg width=600 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Caption:&nbsp;Chris Botti with Katie Couric at a basketball game in New York on 2006</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>Photo Credit: gettyimages.com <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Chris even stated,</p><p>“That’s very difficult—very, very difficult. Its fun if you just want to go have dinner with someone, be superficial, but a couple of times I’ve gone out and it’s been really great, and the woman will be like, ‘You’re coming back&nbsp;when?’ So that’s been really hard.”</p><p>He further explained how some of the musicians who get married are not being honest with themselves and said,</p><p>“I think a lot of musicians and actors get married, and they’re not being honest with who they are or what they want, to have another person share in their life. This is hard for me to say in an interview but I think musicians at the core are selfish. The other person has to know that.”</p><p>Now we know why Botti does not have an extensive list of girlfriends.</p><h2>Botti On Tour&nbsp;and Net Worth:</h2><p>As his past girlfriends explained how busy man he is, regarding his work, Chris Botti is again <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">on tours starting this December 4</a> and is entirely occupied till the first week of May. In his entire career, Chris has earned himself a fortune from his shows and the 4+ million copies of his CDs that he sold and even from his concert tickets. Right now, he has a net worth of $8 million, and that is set to escalate with his current tour.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-653 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpqlka%2B2r7OMramupaCawaa%2BjJyfq6GjYq%2BwwNOiZJuqmaO0tHnTq6ymqJWperR51Zqlqq2ZqLWqusZmqq2nk6C9qrjEZqarm5iawLW%2BwGafmqScYrqqus2emKmnnJ7AbsDOrqlnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famazing-trumpeter-chris-botti-brings-trumpet-s-vanquishing-stockpile-orchestra-hall-minneapolis-tour-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2famazing-trumpeter-chris-botti-brings-trumpet-s-vanquishing-stockpile-orchestra-hall-minneapolis-tour-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2famazing-trumpeter-chris-botti-brings-trumpet-s-vanquishing-stockpile-orchestra-hall-minneapolis-tour-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2famazing-trumpeter-chris-botti-brings-trumpet-s-vanquishing-stockpile-orchestra-hall-minneapolis-tour-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famazing-trumpeter-chris-botti-brings-trumpet-s-vanquishing-stockpile-orchestra-hall-minneapolis-tour-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2famazing-trumpeter-chris-botti-brings-trumpet-s-vanquishing-stockpile-orchestra-hall-minneapolis-tour-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-fallout-games.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-fallout-games.html>Best Fallout Games Ranked: New Vegas, Fallout 76</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./12-extraordinary-facts-about-mount-gasherbrum-i.html>12 Extraordinary Facts About Mount Gasherbrum I</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./12-extraordinary-facts-about-mount-gasherbrum-i.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
