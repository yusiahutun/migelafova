<time>11 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Just shy of her 50th birthday, the actress says she feels sexier than ever.</p><p>She was one of the hottest women on TV back in the '90s thanks to her role on <a href=#>"Baywatch"</a> -- but maintaining that appearance wasn't healthy for star Gena Lee Nolin.</p><p>Appearing on Monday's new episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"The Doctors,"</a> the actress -- who turns 50 later this month -- opens up about having an eating disorder during her time on the swimsuit-filled series as Neely Capshaw.</p><p>She said that she "definitely" did not realize she had a problem at the time, however.</p><p>"You look around in your environment, you're in Hollywood and everyone is thin," she said in this exclusive TooFab preview. "Everyone is beautiful. So I knew that I had to look a certain way. I couldn't escape being almost half naked."</p><p>In an extended preview at the episode up on the show's website, Nolin explained how her first big break was being a Barker Beauty for "The Price Is Right." She noted that being on television was "an enormous pressure" for her."</p><p>"I wouldn't eat. I mean, maybe, one meal in a week," she said. "We would have meetings in the morning with a ton of food lined up. I would get a bagel, put a little spread on it and I did it for show. I would pretend to have a bite and then I would spit it out."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/11/4by3/2021/11/12/11ca8f11ff0e4774a972cc4ae6ccea98_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p>Once she landed "Baywatch," her situation didn't improve.</p><p>"I realized quickly that you had to have a phenomenal figure, you had to have the curves and everything that went with it. It was hard to remain so tiny. I barely ate," she explained. "When I knew I had a break, I would just binge. I would eat and eat and eat, then of course, starve until I got it off. It was this vicious cycle. Looking back, I realized how sick I was, I had an eating disorder."</p><p>She says she got it under control when she was 37 and now, at 49, she adds that she's "never felt sexier than I do right now."</p><p>In another exclusive clip, Nolin also revealed she had her breast implants removed.</p><p>"Because of my auto-immune and Hashimoto and thyroid issues that I've had for several years, I had my implants taken out and that was a really, really big [decision]," she explained.</p><p>As Dr. Andrew Ordon noted, explant surgery is a very common trend right now -- adding that, "for a lot of women, that makes them feel and look better."</p><p>Of her explant surgery, Nolin tells TooFab she had it done in September 2019.</p><p>"I've never looked back after being implant free," she said. "Don't get me wrong, there have been times where I wouldn't mind a little more up top, but that's when my sister Victoria Secret comes in hand."</p><p>"I feel healthier and I highly recommend women listen to their bodies, BII (breast implant illness) is very real." she added. "I also realized that I am beautiful the way I am naturally. That's a big ah ha moment."</p><p>Nolin's full chat with "The Doctors" airs Monday, November 15. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Check local listings.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7kGpmampfnLKvrYylnJ5lnqS5qrqMrZ%2BeZZSksLW70axknrCTocK0tdWeZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgena-lee-nolin-the-doctors-exclusive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgena-lee-nolin-the-doctors-exclusive.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgena-lee-nolin-the-doctors-exclusive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgena-lee-nolin-the-doctors-exclusive.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgena-lee-nolin-the-doctors-exclusive.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgena-lee-nolin-the-doctors-exclusive.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./supporters-back-restoration-of-moline-landmark.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./supporters-back-restoration-of-moline-landmark.html>Supporters back restoration of Moline landmark</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./an-american-classic-1920s-house-used-oscar-winning-movie-driving-miss-daisy-1-9million-html.html>An American classic: 1920s house used in the Oscar-winning movie Driving Miss Daisy could be yours f</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./an-american-classic-1920s-house-used-oscar-winning-movie-driving-miss-daisy-1-9million-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
