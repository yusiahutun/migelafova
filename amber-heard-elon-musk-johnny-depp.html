During her testimony, she opened up about how she befriended <a href=#>Elon Musk</a> while attending the Met Gala alone.</p><p>She explained that while Depp was initially supposed to join her and be dressed by Ralph Lauren for the event on May 2, 2016, he was off the grid following their alleged fight on her 30th birthday. She said he missed his fitting and nobody on Depp's team would communicate with her about whether he would show.</p><p>"I ended up going by myself," she said. "Frankly, I wasn't sure if he'd show up on the carpet or show up at the hotel shortly before. I had no way of knowing."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:dd3d4227-40ea-43bc-9dd0-8aa38bbbc381 data-container-ref=toofab:article:87133c62-e5c3-4f1c-9489-2d299e80b08a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7f/5by4/2022/05/16/7f2e2d4733d14dbd9a0bbda0f5ea053f_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Amber Heard Says Johnny Depp Was 'Irate' Over Sex Scene, James Franco</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I got out of the car and walked the red carpet by myself, escorted by somebody from Ralph Lauren's team and I sat next to an empty place setting for Johnny that they cleared as soon as they realized he had effectively stood me up on the red carpet."</p><p>She said that while at the event, she started talking to Musk, who she said she didn't initially recognize but had met him once before.</p><p>"He seemed like a real gentleman, he was really nice," she added.

I believe I was in London at the time," said Heard, who said it seemed like someone had the "wrong date." She added, "I did [mushrooms and MDMA] at the Coachella music festival and that was the end of that, I learned that the hard way that that was a terrible idea."</p><p>Overall, she said there were "a lot of mistakes" in Falati's testimony -- denying she ever admitted to having an addiction to cocaine, an eating disorder or being diagnosed as bipolar or having codependency issues. She admitted, however, that now she realizes her relationship with Depp was codependent.</p><p>Heard is still on the stand.</p><p>Depp is seeking $50 million in damages after Heard claimed she was a survivor of domestic abuse in an op-ed in the Washington Post in 2018. While she didn't name Depp in the piece, his lawyers argue it was implied to be about him and negatively affected his career. She countersued Depp for $100 million.</p><p>The actor has already lost an earlier lawsuit he took in the UK over the same article that appeared in The Sun. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://toofab.com/tags/johnnydepp/>See all of our ongoing coverage here.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j25mam5flrqjsdFmn56Zopl6prjOp2SmraOgequ7x6elsmWUmr2xew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famber-heard-elon-musk-johnny-depp.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2famber-heard-elon-musk-johnny-depp.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2famber-heard-elon-musk-johnny-depp.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2famber-heard-elon-musk-johnny-depp.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famber-heard-elon-musk-johnny-depp.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2famber-heard-elon-musk-johnny-depp.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dua-lipa-goth-outfit.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dua-lipa-goth-outfit.html>Is Dua Lipa Goth Now or What?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./taylor-swift-lover-tracklist-leak-details-revealed.html>Taylor Swift's 'Lover' Tracklist Leak Details Have Been Revealed &amp;amp; OMG</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./taylor-swift-lover-tracklist-leak-details-revealed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
