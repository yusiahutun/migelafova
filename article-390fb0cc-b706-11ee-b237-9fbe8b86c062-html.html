The trial, which was originally set for Jan. 29, is now scheduled to begin on June 10 at the Harrison County courthouse in Gulfport.</p><p>Walters is charged with first-degree murder and aggravated assault in the shooting death of 45-year-old James Corey Donald of Ovett outside The Rock Church off Highway 15 South, just outside the Laurel city limits, on the evening of April 2. Walters was an off-duty reserve deputy with the Jones County Sheriff’s Department but was reportedly serving as a member of the church’s security officer at the time.</p><p>The case “has been the subject of extensive publicity and public scrutiny,” Walters’ attorneys wrote, singling out the Leader-Call and WDAM, along with social-media posts, to make the case for moving the trial. “The alleged victim ... is a member of the community, and he has relationships with many citizens of Jones County, and said relationships will impair (Walters’) ability to receive a fair trial in Jones County.</p><p>“It is anticipated that this trial will invoke a great deal of emotion, which will render (Walters’) ability to receive a fair trial in Jones County impossible.</p><p>“It is in the best interest of justice that the trial of this matter be held in a county outside of Jones County and outside the 18th Circuit Court District.”</p><p>Pickard, a senior status judge from Copiah County who was appointed by the state Supreme Court to hear the case, ruled that the trial would be moved.</p><p>The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation handled the case and Jasper County District Attorney Chris Hennis is serving as the special prosecutor because of Walters’ ties to the JCSD and local DA’s office. Judge Dal Williamson recused himself from the case because he represented Walters in a divorce and is friends with him and his father.</p><p>Walters is free on $300,000 bond. He was initially charged with second-degree murder after claiming self-defense, but after investigators with MBI saw security surveillance footage from the incident and took the case to a grand jury, the charge was upgraded.</p><p>The indictment for first-degree murder says that Walters killed Donald “by shooting him in the back with a Glock 48, 9mm handgun.” The indictment for aggravated assault says that Walters caused “serious bodily harm by kicking James Corey Donald in the head ...”</p><p>Surveillance video showed Donald “reapproaching” a side door of the church when Walters met him and “initiated a physical confrontation,” striking Donald “in the face with his fist,” MBI agent Zach Summers testified.</p><p>Donald then turned around and ran as Walters “gave chase, pulled his gun and shot,” Summers said. Donald continued to run before “coming to rest” at the southeast corner of the church.</p><p>When Walters got to Donald, he “kicked him in the head,” Summers said.</p><p>When the investigator testified to that in his initial appearance in Jones County Justice Court, Walters’ knees buckled and he slumped down before being wheeled out of the courtroom on a stretcher to an ambulance outside. He was later released on $50,000 bond.</p><p>Donald was transported by EMServ Ambulance to South Central Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead shortly after the shooting. The autopsy showed the cause of death was a “gunshot wound to the back,” and it was noted that he had a hemorrhage and abrasions on the side of his head. The manner of death was ruled as homicide, Summers said.</p><p>Walters was not in Jones County Circuit Court for the most recent motion hearing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcK%2FHrqmcoF2YvLF5wpqqnmWdpMOmsIytpmabn5bAtXvAq6uim5yarHSFj5%2BZaZuTYq94fJVmaGqdlWKvc3%2BWZnCfmpVtr3mCwmlta2aYqbqt</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2farticle-390fb0cc-b706-11ee-b237-9fbe8b86c062-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2farticle-390fb0cc-b706-11ee-b237-9fbe8b86c062-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2farticle-390fb0cc-b706-11ee-b237-9fbe8b86c062-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2farticle-390fb0cc-b706-11ee-b237-9fbe8b86c062-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2farticle-390fb0cc-b706-11ee-b237-9fbe8b86c062-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2farticle-390fb0cc-b706-11ee-b237-9fbe8b86c062-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./143432-meet-miracle-girl-whose-brain-grows-head-photos-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./143432-meet-miracle-girl-whose-brain-grows-head-photos-html.html>Girl born with brain growing outside her skull survives</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./13-facts-about-cheerleading.html>13 Facts About Cheerleading - Facts.net</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./13-facts-about-cheerleading.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
