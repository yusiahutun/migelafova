They have been around since the show’s debut in 2011 and have only gotten bigger in time, with <a href=#>their very own film</a> set to hit select theaters on Feb. 21.</p><p id=par-2_27>We could go on and on about their <a href=#>career highlights and accomplishments</a>, but what about their personal lives? Like, are they dating anyone? And if so, who?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Stars-of-Impractical-Jokers.jpg><h2>Joe Gatto has been off the market for years</h2><p id=par-3_17>He’s been married to his wife, Bessy Gatto, since 2013. Joe, 43, is the only married Joker.</p><p id=par-4_32>Joe and Bessy tied the knot in <a href=#>a sweet outdoor ceremony</a> following a years-long relationship. They welcomed their first child, daughter Milana, in 2015 and had a son, Joseph, two years later.</p><p id=par-5_31>Judging from her Instagram page, Bessy appears to spend much of her time with her children. When she’s not, she likes to travel and play with her family’s many dogs.</p><p id=par-6_30>It’s unclear if she works, but some <a href=#>reports</a> say she manages her husband’s social media accounts. Hey, you know what they say — a couple who works together, stays together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><h2>Sal Vulcano seems single</h2><p id=par-7_37>In comparison to the other Jokers, Sal’s relationship history is a lot murkier. It seems that he’s never dated anyone during his time on the show, and there’s very limited information online regarding his most recent relationship.</p><p id=par-8_27>Viewers did get to see Sal, 43, have <a href=#>a “date night”</a> in a 2019 Impractical Jokers clip, but every possible thing that could go wrong did.</p><p id=par-9_24>But considering that fans are constantly flirting with him on the show, maybe he’ll have better luck in the love department down the line.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><h2>Brian ‘Q’ Quinn has a complicated relationship history</h2><p id=par-10_36>Q, 43, is also famously single. Though he’s been linked to a couple of people in the past, he has never officially come out and gone public with anyone during his time on Impractical Jokers.</p><p id=par-11_59>According to <a href=#>Looper</a>, though, Q once confessed on the series that his first girlfriend is related to an A-list celebrity and that she served time in prison. Internet sleuths claim that the mystery woman is King of Queens star <a href=#>Leah Remini’s half-sister Elizabeth</a>, who was arrested in 2005 on drug charges, but Q has yet to address the rumor.</p><p id=par-12_39>His last known relationship was with a woman who apparently left him for a police officer. Q has said on the show that the two were engaged when it happened and seemed like he still hadn’t gotten over it.</p><p id=par-13_33>The failed romance has become a running joke on the show, with practically all of the Jokers poking fun at his fiancée taking off and leaving him behind with a bunch of cats.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><h2>James ‘Murr’ Murray has found his person</h2><p id=par-14_32>As of writing, Murr, 43, is engaged to his partner Melyssa Davies. Not much is known about her, but <a href=#>People</a> reported in September 2019 that she had recently graduated from nursing school.</p><p id=par-15_47>They met by chance in June 2018 when Davies attended a press event for Murr’s novel Awakened and were instantly attracted to each other. Just over a year later, in August 2019, Murr popped the question at the New Jersey home he had recently purchased with Davies.</p><p id=par-16_38>“I set up a picnic and champagne and a Scrabble board. I took her there to sign ‘documents’ [about the house] — there were no documents to sign,” Murray explained to People. “And thank God she said yes.”</p><p id=par-17_27>Davies was over the moon, admitting that she had wanted to marry Murr “for a while now.” She added: “I am so myself around him. It’s amazing.”</p><p id=par-18_1>Aww!</p><p id=par-19_35>It’ll be the second marriage for Murr, who was previously married to Sal’s sister, Jenna Vulcano. He got hitched in 2014 as a punishment for Impractical Jokers but had the marriage annulled the following day.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-5><p></p></figure><p id=par-20_12><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=#>Which Star of ‘Impractical Jokers’ Has the Highest Net Worth?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqbuMmqmeZaSdsm6%2F05qprGWfm3qquc%2BrmJysmZiurXnJqKKeqqNisaLAyKeeZ6Ckorlw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-the-stars-of-impractical-jokers-dating-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-the-stars-of-impractical-jokers-dating-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-the-stars-of-impractical-jokers-dating-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-the-stars-of-impractical-jokers-dating-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-the-stars-of-impractical-jokers-dating-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-the-stars-of-impractical-jokers-dating-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./taylor-swift-leaving-las-vegas-private-jet-after-travis-kelce-super-bowl-win.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./taylor-swift-leaving-las-vegas-private-jet-after-travis-kelce-super-bowl-win.html>Taylor Swift Leaving Las Vegas After Travis Kelce Super Bowl Win</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./netherlands-queen-maxima-beige-monochrome-look-outing.html>The Netherlands' Queen Maxima shows beige isn't boring in must-see look</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./netherlands-queen-maxima-beige-monochrome-look-outing.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
