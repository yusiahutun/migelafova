hitmen to kill her husband and his mother</p><p><span>The family of Miami hotelier Ben Novack Jr has hired a genealogist in a bid to find a new heir to the $10m fortune currently in the hands of his former stripper widow who accused of arranging his murder.</span></p><p><span>Narcy Novack, 53, is alleged to have watched the two hitmen she hired beat her husband with barbells before ordering them to gouge out his eyes with a utility knife.<br></span></p><p><span>She and her brother, Cristobal Veliz, 55, are scheduled to stand trial in April charged with arranging the murders of both Novack and his elderly mother, Bernice.<br></span></p><p><span>In his will Novack Jr, left his entire estate, including a Batman collection worth $2million, to his wife.</span></p><p><span>But under state law she would lose all rights to her husband’s wealth if she were found guilty of killing him.<br></span></p><p><span>The estate would then become the property of Narcy Novack’s daughter from a previous marriage, May Abad, 36, and Abad’s two teenage sons.</span></p><p><span>Now family members have hired respected Daytona-based genealogist Harvey E Morse, in the hope of finding new heirs.</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li

and was featured in the James Bond film Goldfinger.</span></p><p><span>Novack Sr lost the Fontainebleau to bankruptcy but his son set up in business for himself following in the family his footsteps opening a successful Fort Lauderdale-based convention planning business, Convention Concepts Unlimited.<br></span></p><p><span>At its peak the company earned $50 million a year.</span></p><p><span>Nearly all the personal belongings of Novack and his mother have already been sold or auctioned off.</span></p><p><span>Among these were Novack's collection of Batman memorabilia, considered to be the second largest in the world, which included a Batmobile made from the original mold used for the vehicle in the TV series.</span></p><p><span>Bernice Novack, a former model, lived a life of grandeur in her Fort Lauderdale home filled with mementos, including a piano once used by Frank Sinatra.<br></span></p><p><span>Palm Beach attorney Mark Hanson, who filed the petition, claims that if they were to inherit the estate Nancy Novack's grandsons could conceivably use it to benefit their grandmother.</span></p><p><span>However that idea was dismissed as 'ludicrous' by the mother May Abad's attorney William Crawford, who pointed out that not only has Abad been feuding with her mother since childhood but she also believes she is guilty of killing her stepfather.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/02/24/article-0-0042BEBD00000258-430_468x359.jpg height=359 width=468 alt="Passion: Novack's collection of
