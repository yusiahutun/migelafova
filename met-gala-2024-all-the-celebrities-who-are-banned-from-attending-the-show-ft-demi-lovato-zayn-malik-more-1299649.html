She said, “As wonderful as it is, Vogue will not improve a designer's business. However, if an unknown brand is worn by a celebrity in a tabloid, it will become the most popular designer within a week."</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2 id=662cfc1549085><strong>Donald Trump</strong></h2><p><a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Met Gala 2024: All The Celebrities Who Are Banned From Attending The Show ft.

Anna Wintour reaffirmed her prohibition. In an interview with James Corden, she took the former president's name when asked which celebrity she would never, ever invite to the Met Gala.</p><h2 id=662cfc1549088><strong>Demi Lovato</strong></h2><p><img alt="Demi Lovato Met Gala" title="Demi Lovato Met Gala" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-04/1714134409_demi-lovato-met-gala.jpg></p><p>In a 2018 interview with Billboard, Demi Lovato openly spoke about their Met Gala experience. And since then, they have not attended. Sharing their experience, they said, "I had a terrible experience. This one celebrity was a total jerk who was unpleasant to be around. It was quite cliquey. I remember feeling so uncomfortable that I wanted to drink.” They also said that they went to AA meetings directly after attending the Met Gala, and they were able to relate to those homeless people more than people at the Met Gala. The celebrity also made fun of how embarrassed they felt at the Met Gala in a now-deleted Instagram post, which they justified when taken out of context.</p><h2 id=662cfc154908e><strong>Amy Schumer</strong></h2><p>Amy Schumer has not been permanently banned from the Met Gala. In a 2016 interview with Howard Stern, she made it clear how she felt about the event. She said, "People are pretending to have a discussion. I do not enjoy the farce. We are dressed up like a bunch of fucking bastards. I do not like it. I'm not interested in fashion. I don't care."</p><h2 id=662cfc1549092><strong>Tim Gunn&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Tim Gunn was barred from attending the Met Gala after making such a claim in 2016. He said, "This is extremely true. It's a weird story, but, in my opinion, it's pretty straightforward. When asked what the most memorable thing I've ever seen in fashion was, I replied, 'It's simple. It was watching Anna Wintour being carried down five flights of stairs by two bodyguards and two large hulking men after a fashion presentation. All hell broke loose. That was insane. Since then, we've been fighting openly.”&nbsp;</p><h2 id=662cfc1549094><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></h2><p><img alt="Gwyneth Paltrow" title="Gwyneth Paltrow" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-04/1714134468_gwyneth-paltrow-met-gala.jpg></p><p>In 2013, <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Met Gala 2024: All The Celebrities Who Are Banned From Attending The Show ft.

In an interview with Kylie and the Jackie O Show, she said, "It appears to be the best thing in the world... You always think, Oh my god, it's going to be so glamorous and amazing, and you're going to see all these people, but when you get there, it's so hot and crowded, and everyone is pressing you. I think we're all a little old to dress up as punk." Although Paltrow didn’t return to the Met Gala carpet in 2017 and 2019,.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2><strong>Zayn Malik</strong></h2><p>In 2016, Zayn Malik attended the glamorous event with his now ex-girlfriend Gigi Hadid. But in 2018, in an interview with GQ, he made it very clear that it's not something he would attend. He said, "I'd prefer to be staying at home and doing something constructive rather than dressing up in extremely costly clothes and being photographed on a red carpet... to do the self-indulgent 'look at me, I'm amazing' thing on the red carpet; it's not me."</p><h2><strong>Tina Fey&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Tina Fey is also among the few who don't like to attend the event. In 2015, in an interview with David Letterman, she said, "I went there once, and it was such a jerk parade. Clearly, I'll never go back, but if you do, it's a gorgeous space with every jerk from every walk of life wearing some idiotic item. You climb up these massive steps. I went and pulled my husband along with me, which I'm now in trouble for."</p><h2><strong>Lili Reinhart</strong></h2><p>Lili Reinhart had the honor of attending the Met Gala in 2022. But after her Instagram Story, in which she commented on Kim Kardashian’s weight loss journey, the Riverdale actress believes she wouldn’t get invited to the event again. In a following interview with W Magazine, Reinhart opened up about the event, stating, "Was fun, but after going again this year, I don't think I'll be invited back. I said something about a certain person wearing specific clothing."&nbsp;</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Met Gala 2024: All The Celebrities Who Are Banned From Attending The Show ft.
