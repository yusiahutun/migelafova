But fans know that Brice's brawny exterior is simply an outer shell, and underneath lies an sentimental singer-songwriter with a penchant for sweeping women off their feet.</p><p>Brice first hit the scene in 2010 and has been building an impressive library of hits ranging from touching ballads and lighthearted love songs to laid-back party songs for parking lot shindigs ever since. We've put together a list of which tunes are his Top 5 --&nbsp;you know, if we&nbsp;had to choose.</p><ul><li><span class=count>5</span><h2>'I Don't Dance'</h2>From 'I Don't Dance' (2014)<p>Tapping into his romantic side, Brice co-wrote the title track to his third studio album, ‘I Don’t Dance,’ a song about the kind of love that makes you do anything for your significant other. The sweet, lighthearted lyrics would be music to any woman’s ear, especially lines like: "you took these two left feet and waltzed away with my heart." The song was Brice's first single off the 2014 album and peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Airplay charts as well as No. 5 on the Hot Country charts. No one’s complaining about Brice’s dance moves when he can croon like this.</p></li><li><span class=count>4</span><h2>'More Than a Memory'</h2>Released on Garth Brooks' 'The Ultimate Hits' (2007)<p>Though a different artist with a certain signature black cowboy hat made this song famous, Brice is one of the original songwriters. Watching Brice perform ‘More Than a Memory,’ it’s clear he identifies with the lyrics he penned. His passion bursts through and his vocals are powerful, resulting in a moving performance. The song is a glimpse into the lasting sadness that comes from a difficult breakup and the uphill battle to move on. It’s a gut-wrencher, and anyone who has experienced deep heartbreak knows exactly what Brice is singing about. <a href=#>Garth Brooks</a> released the song on his 2007 'The Ultimate Hits' record and took it to No. 1 on the Hot Country charts, but Brice still gives it his all in every performance.</p></li><li><span class=count>3</span><h2>'Love Like Crazy'</h2>From 'Love Like Crazy' (2010)<p>Brice’s first hit, ‘Love Like Crazy,’ is a touching mid-tempo ballad about a lasting legacy built by working hard, living honestly and loving well. Brice tells the story of an older man who took some chances in his life at the risk of looking crazy to others, but always kept his priorities straight. Brice’s genuine admiration and sincerity shine through his strong vocal performance as he dispenses the man’s advice for living a fulfilled life. The title track on Brice’s debut studio album, ‘Love Like Crazy’ was released in 2009 and spent a record-breaking 56 weeks on the Billboard Hot Country chart, peaking at No. 3. The song brought the artist to the forefront of mainstream country and was even named Billboard Year End’s Top Country Song of 2010. The song clearly resonated with country fans and is a must-have on the list of Lee Brice’s best songs.</p></li><li><span class=count>2</span><h2>'A Woman Like You'</h2>From 'Hard 2 Love' (2012)<p>‘A Woman Like You’ is a love song with a dash of realism — a sweet and clever twist on the idea that men would prefer bachelor lifestyle to being married. It comes down to one thing every woman wants to hear: sure, I’d watch more football and eat more takeout if we had never gotten together, but all of it pales in comparison to being with you. Brice delivers the song with warmth and sincerity, making this romantic song believable and earning it a slot on wedding playlists everywhere. ‘A Woman Like You’ was the first single off Brice’s 2012 album ‘Hard 2 Love.' It reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country charts, and there's no question why it made this list of Brice's songs.</p></li><li><span class=count>1</span><h2>'I Drive Your Truck'</h2>From 'Hard 2 Love' (2012)<p>Brice knows how to deliver a tearjerker, and ‘I Drive Your Truck’ is a shining example. The third single from his second studio album ‘Hard 2 Love,’ the ballad is an emotional tribute to a brother who has passed away while serving in the armed forces from the point of view of the brother left behind. The narrator drives his brother’s truck to feel close to him now that he is gone. Brice sings the story with such conviction, it’s surprising to learn that he didn’t write it himself. His passionate vocal performance combined with the skillful storytelling in this tune make it one of Brice’s best tracks. It reached No. 1 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart and No. 6 on the Billboard Hot Country chart. Oh, and it's No. 1 here.</p></li></ul><h2>What Are Your Favorite Lee Brice Songs?</h2><p>Are these five Lee Brice songs worthy of being named the best of the best?
