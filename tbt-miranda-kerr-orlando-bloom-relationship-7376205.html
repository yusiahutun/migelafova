It was there that Orlando asked for Miranda’s number, but she refused to give it to him. The model had a good reason, though — she was seeing someone else at the time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We were friends for a while, and then it just developed into a little more,” she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Hello!</a> in September 2008 about their initial meeting. “He was a little bit cheeky, actually. He got my number from my agent because I wouldn’t give it to him. Then he called and said, ‘We can just be friends.’ I was like, ‘OK, then.'”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kerr also admitted that Bloom’s fame was another factor that made her hesitant to date him. "I was reluctant — not about him, but the idea of that (him being a movie star),” she told the Australian TV show Sunday Night in 2011, adding that his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>“persistence”</a> is what eventually won her over. “Maybe he wanted me because he thought he couldn't have me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the first few months of dating, Kerr and Bloom kept their relationship as private as possible before deciding to make their couple debut in April 2008 at Doncaster Day in Sydney, which is Kerr’s hometown, making it the perfect opportunity for Bloom to meet the parents, which he did.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two years later, they announced they were engaged, and a month after that, it was revealed that Kerr and Bloom got married during a top-secret ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them: </strong>You’d be hard-pressed to find a couple more supportive of each other’s careers than Bloom and Kerr. No matter where in the world Kerr was walking a runway, Bloom was there sitting in the front row, while the model couldn’t help but often gush about her husband’s superior acting skills.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kerr told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Cosmopolitan</a> in the magazine’s November 2013 issue, "When I saw Orlando on Broadway in Romeo and Juliet, I was blown away. For someone to be able to learn all that and hold the energy to do it every day, six days a week — I have so much respect for him.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, they respected each other’s art forms from a distance. “We don't run lines, though. We keep that very separate,” she said. “That would be like me asking him to teach me how to catwalk."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked: </strong>The genetically-blessed couple passed on their good looks and welcomed their first child together, Flynn Christopher Blanchard Copeland Bloom, on Jan. 6, 2011.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Surprisingly, Flynn's long name is partially <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>a tribute to Kerr’s high school sweetheart</a>, Christopher Middlebrook, who died in a car accident when he was a teenager. "After he died, I wrote him a letter that said I hoped to name my first child after him in some way. I told Orlando, and he was the one who said he'd be happy to do that,” she explained of the couple’s decision. “Orlando's a good guy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup: </strong>After three years of marriage and six years together total, Miranda and Orlando announced they were separating in October 2013.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“They have been amicably separated for the past few months,” a rep for the couple said at the time. “After six years together, they have recently decided to formalize their separation. Despite this being the end of their marriage, they love, support and respect each other as both parents of their son and as family."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kerr had a hard time with the breakup at first and revealed that she “fell into a bad depression” shortly after they split. “When Orlando and I separated, I actually fell into a really bad depression,” she told Elle Canada in 2016. “I never understood the depth of that feeling or the reality of that because I was naturally a very happy person.” Years later, Miranda elaborated further, explaining that she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>“didn’t believe in love anymore”</a> and felt “a little bit overwhelmed with what had happened."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the major heartbreak, Bloom and Kerr were determined to stay friends. “We love each other. We’re a family. We’re going to be in each other’s lives for the rest of our lives,” Orlando <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told</a> Katie Couric shortly after their split. “There’s no question that for the sake of our son and everything else, we’re going to support one another and love each other as parents to Flynn.” He continued, “Life sometimes doesn’t work out exactly as we plan or hope for,” Bloom added. “But we’re adults … We’re professionals. We love and care about each other. Most of all, we love our son.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now: </strong>Bloom's first serious relationship post-divorce was with his now-wife Katy Perry in 2016. Katy and Orlando broke up after less than a year of dating but reunited in 2018. They got engaged on Valentine's Day 2019 and welcomed a daughter, Daisy Dove, the following year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to making movies, Bloom has also tried out TV acting, lending his voice to a cartoon version of Prince Harry in HBO Max's The Prince, as well as starring as the lead in the Emmy-nominated Amazon Prime series Carnival Row (the third season is currently streaming).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A year after her divorce from Bloom, Kerr met her now-husband, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel. Their relationship started off slow — they were friends before they started officially dating. The couple went Instagram official in 2016 and got engaged that same year. They tied the knot with a backyard wedding in 2017 and welcomed two sons — Hart, 4, and 3-year-old Myles — soon after.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kerr retired her angel wings in 2014 but is still a model, working with brands like Louis Vuitton and Eterne, as well as her own beauty brand Kora Organics, which she launched in 2009.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">#TBT: Check in every Thursday as we throw it back to some of our favorite celebrity couples of all time.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705urZqWZp66vsMBmop6qomK8s7jAp5uoZZKhvLC5jKucpZmknryvv8eip2ZvY2yDc3yU</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftbt-miranda-kerr-orlando-bloom-relationship-7376205.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftbt-miranda-kerr-orlando-bloom-relationship-7376205.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftbt-miranda-kerr-orlando-bloom-relationship-7376205.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftbt-miranda-kerr-orlando-bloom-relationship-7376205.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftbt-miranda-kerr-orlando-bloom-relationship-7376205.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftbt-miranda-kerr-orlando-bloom-relationship-7376205.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bobby-short.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bobby-short.html>Who is Bobby Short dating?
