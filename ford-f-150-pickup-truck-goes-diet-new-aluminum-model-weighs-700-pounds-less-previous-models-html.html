Dealers who have seen the new F-150 say they expect to encounter some skepticism, but the change had to be made.</span></p><p><span>'We're aggressive, stretching the envelope,' said Sam Pack, owner of four Ford dealerships in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

It's widely used on sporty, low-volume cars now, like the Tesla Model S electric sedan and the Land Rover Evoque. U.S. Postal Service trucks are also made of aluminum.</span></p><p><span>Ford has spent decades researching the metal. Twenty years ago, the company built a fleet of 20 all-aluminum experimental sedans.</span><br></p><p><span>Later, it used aluminum on exotic cars from Aston-Martin and Jaguar, brands it used to own. But up to now, Ford limited the aluminum on its trucks to the hoods and used steel for the rest.</span></p><p><span>New government fuel economy requirements, which mandate that automakers' cars and trucks get a combined 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, are speeding the switch to aluminum.<br></span></p><p><span>Chrysler's Ram is currently the most fuel-efficient pickup, getting 25 mpg on the highway.<br></span></p><p><span>The current F-150 gets as much as 23 mpg.

CEO Alan Mulally, a former Boeing Co. executive who joined Ford in 2006, encouraged his team to think bigger.<br></span></p><p><span>After all, it was Mulally who led early development of Boeing's Dreamliner, which replaced aluminum with even lighter-weight plastics to be more efficient and fly further.</span></p><p><span>'Everything becomes more efficient once you take the weight out,' Mulally says.

The company says the new truck will tow more and haul more, since the engine doesn't have to account for so much weight. It can also accelerate and stop more quickly. Aluminum doesn't rust, Ford says, and it's more resistant to dents.</span></p><p><span>Reyes says the company planted prototype F-150s with three companies - in mining, construction and power - for two years without revealing they were aluminum. The companies didn't notice a difference.</span></p><p><span>Mulally says Ford's customers have already shown a willingness to adopt new technology. Forty percent of the F-Series trucks sold last year had Ford's more efficient EcoBoost engines, for example, which were introduced just three years ago. And Mulally says owners trust Ford.</span></p><p><span>Ford will still have a tough time wresting customers from the competition, mainly Chevrolet, GMC and Ram, says Jesse Toprak, an independent auto industry consultant in Los Angeles.</span></p><p><span>'Movement between brands in the full-size truck segment is extremely minimal,' Toprak says.

The company with the newest, most advanced truck has the advantage in getting those customers, plus those who are new to the market, Toprak says.</span></p><p><span>Some steel remains on the truck. The frame beneath it is built primarily of high-strength steel, which Ford says will make it tougher and stiffer than the current frame.<br></span></p><p><span>There's also steel in the front dashboard, because Ford thought steel was better at dampening nose from the engine.</span></p><p><span>In all, a four-door F-150 has 660 pounds of aluminum, or nearly double the average use of aluminum per vehicle used now, according to Drive Aluminum, an aluminum industry Web site.<br></span></p><p><span>If the Ford truck is a success, use of aluminum could expand rapidly at the expense of steel.</span></p><p><span>'People are beginning to truly understand the value that aluminum can bring to the table,' Lowery said.</span></p><p><span>Ford is expecting some issues with the design or the manufacturing as it makes the change, Mulally said. But the company is working hard to troubleshoot.</span></p><p><span>'I think the attitude is, expect the unexpected and expect to deal with it,' he says. 'Sometimes I think our core competency is scrambling.
