We are constantly inspired by their effortlessly chic aesthetic, tempted to cut our hair into <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>French girl bobs</a> or wear a classic Gallic <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>red lip</a> on the regular. But what about French girl skincare? How do they take care of their skin and keep it naturally glowing and seemingly blemish-free?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It comes as no surprise that the way the French approach skincare is not as simple as just using <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>acne treatments</a>. It's much more of a philosophy and lifestyle. To learn more, we turned to the source, of course. See below for how three French beauty experts navigate acne and treat breakouts.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-its-a-holistic-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>It's a Holistic Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Treating acne goes beyond using the right skin-care products. For the French, it's all about looking at the whole picture and considering what your lifestyle is doing to your overall health.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think back to the root and the cause of a skin challenge, focusing less on the consequences," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Violette</a>, makeup artist and founder of Violette_FR. "I’ll ask questions like, 'What is acne? What does your skin need for it to be overall healthy before thinking of the consequences?' This train of thought is based on the skin-care knowledge I grew up with. From a young [age], I learned to seek expert advice from dermatologists, pharmacists, and estheticians. We were very fortunate to have pharmacies that were accessible to us, so I relied quite heavily on their knowledge and recommendations."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Prevention is better than having to cure the issue," adds <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Natacha Bonjout</a>, a French pharmacist and founder of Bonjout Beauty. "The French believe that it is better to prevent acne from occurring in the first place rather than to treat it after it has already developed. They focus on using gentle, non-comedogenic skincare products that will not clog pores or trigger breakouts."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bonjout goes on to say that you should consider implementing changes that will contribute to a healthier lifestyle overall to clear and treat acne. Her tips include drinking enough water every day, exercising, getting enough sleep, and eating a diet full of nutrients. She also recommends washing your bed sheets once a week, washing your hands often, and even taking supplements.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-keep-skincare-minimal></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Keep Skincare Minimal</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Regine Berthelot</a>, lead esthetician for Caudalie, emphasizes that French skincare philosophy is all about the "less is more" approach. It's about looking at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>causes of inflammation</a>, removing triggers (like processed foods) from your diet, and avoiding products that strip or over-exfoliate the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I encourage clients to curate a skin-care routine focused on balance, like deep cleaning and treating without drying or clogging the skin," she says. "A simple, effective routine of cleanser, toner, serum, and moisturizer twice daily is a fantastic way to start."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This ties back into our minimalist approach to beauty," adds Violette. "With skincare, we don’t want to feed our skin with excess products that have strong and powerful ingredients. It’s good to have our skin be able to learn and defend itself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She recalls learning this lesson while pregnant and experiencing acne for the first time. It wasn't until she stripped down her routine that her skin started to clear up. "My skin was very inflamed, my skin barrier was damaged. Because I hadn’t dealt with this before (no acne or bad breakouts in the past), I panicked," she says. "Once I was calm, I realized that it’s all about focusing on taking care of yourself and not hiding from it. It wasn’t easy, but I realized I needed to practice what I preach and not use foundation on my skin. It went away after three weeks, keeping skincare minimal and allowing for my skin to breathe and heal on its own."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-beauty-is-a-mindset></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Beauty Is a Mindset</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the crux of French beauty is a relaxed attitude around beauty in general. Makeup, skincare, and hair aren't meant to alter your appearance with the goal of becoming what society deems beautiful; it's about celebrating your natural attributes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I move to America, one of the first things I [learned] was to 'be the best version of yourself.' That's similar to [how it is] in France (it's very important to us), but the difference is that we want to learn to love the version of us right now," says Violette. "It doesn't mean we don't want to improve on it or that we don't want to evolve; of course we do. The point is that we don't want to chase a different version of ourselves. That's why we're often in the moment — in the present — with ourselves."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bonjout agrees and says that the French have different skin ideals than the U.S. Where clear skin is often seen as the end goal here, people in France are more accepting of acne occurring and focusing on the products that will actually treat it over time as opposed to aggressive measures that will get rid of blemishes quickly.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Acne is a major skin concern in French skincare, but it is not seen as the same kind of social stigma as it is in the U.S. market," says Bonjout.<strong> </strong>"In France, acne is simply seen as a common skin condition that can affect anyone — regardless of age, gender, or social status. As a result, people with acne in France are not as likely to feel self-conscious or ashamed about their skin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I know it’s easy for me to say, ‘Don’t wear foundation, love yourself. You are perfect.' I totally understand that for people, it’s harder, and they are pushed to wear makeup and hide. That’s ok too," adds Violette. "But I hope that by providing you with this advice, it inspires you. It’s resonating with you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With all that in mind, incorporating the French attitude towards acne is pretty simple. Below are the trusted French brands that all three recommend to treat those blemishes.

"I remember using [the Cleanance Cleansing Gel) every day when I was a teenager," she says. "And all my friends had it as well." Its newest launch, the Cleanance Acne Medicated Clearing Gel Cleanser, contains 2% salicylic acid to clear pores, remove excess oil, and exfoliate skin to keep breakouts at bay. It also contains Avene's signature thermal water, which is clinically shown to calm and soothe any irritation.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-violettefr></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Violette_FR</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To Shop:</strong> $46; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>violettefr.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Violette created her range of products around the French philosophy of simple skincare. The Blemish Rescue is a concentrated serum made of ingredients like southern ginseng, rock rose extract, and carrot stem cells&nbsp;to reduce inflammation and reinforce the skin barrier to get you a clearer and healthier complexion.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[It] really soothes, balances, and calms the sebum," she says. "Though it’s made of 96% naturally derived ingredients, this serum is powerful, which is why it’s used as a treatment base rather than a daily, everyday use."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-la-roche-posay></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>La Roche-Posay</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To Shop:</strong> $22.99; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>ulta.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bonjout calls La Roche-Posay's Effaclar line the French go-to for acneic skin. If you're looking for the ultimate acne spot treatment, she recommends the Effaclar Duo Dual Acne Treatment. "[It's] a corrective anti-blemish care that reduces pimples, blackheads, and marks," she says. It is made with ingredients like benzoyl peroxide and lipo-hydroxy acid to clear away dirt and debris in your pores and reduce irritation.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bioderma></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bioderma</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To Shop:</strong> $18.99; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>dermstore.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If makeup and debris are consistently clogging your pores, a breakout is inevitable. Micellar water, which is a key staple in a French skin-care routine, will help you gently and thoroughly cleanse your skin. For those who are acne-prone, Bonjout recommends the Bioderma Sébium H2O. "[It's] an anti-blemish micellar water that deeply cleanses the skin and reduces pimples, blackheads, and marks," she says. It also won't strip the skin of any essential oils to keep it hydrated.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-caudalie></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Caudalie</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To Shop:</strong> $42; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Caudalie's Vinopure line is Berthelot's pick for a natural approach to treating acne. "[It] has natural ingredients that help reduce potential irritation and inflammation," she says, adding that the Vinopure Purifying Clay Mask, which has grape water and natural zinc and green clay, will absorb excess oil to keep pores clear and soothe any irritation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To further promote a healthy glow, a monthly facial will supply a professional deep cleaning to prevent congestion and build-up. , Alternatively, incorporating a weekly exfoliating routine paired with an at-home mask will help keep skin smooth and clear.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bonjout-beauty></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bonjout Beauty</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To Shop:</strong> $120; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>bonjoutbeauty.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bonjout formulated Le Balm as an all-in-one serum that she says can replace multiple steps of your routine.
