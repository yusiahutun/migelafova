Nearly every temple had similar burrow holes, as well as evidence of stolen artefacts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">French explorers in the late 1800s described Koh Ker as an open-air museum, relatively well preserved due to its isolation up to the mid-20th century. But by the early 21st century, it was clear to Davis that the site had been pillaged, and seeing the destruction of this national cultural heritage would leave an indelible impression on the young archaeologist.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘I was screaming for help’: the Cambodian brides trafficked into China</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As Davis explained to me in October 2022, “there was next to nothing free-standing left”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fast-forward almost two decades, to March 17, 2023, and the long-awaited return of looted antiquities from the United States to Cambodia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At a welcoming ceremony at the Peace Palace in Phnom Penh, Prime Minister Hun Sen unveiled a slew of stolen statues and jewellery, safely home at long last. Among these were the five-foot-tall Hindu god Ganesha, and the magnificent Skanda on a peacock – the Hindu god of war astride his divine bird.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/15/132d18d5-e647-4988-b1f3-e6caca3f149c_90b54f28.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both statues were believed to have been looted from Koh Ker, and passed through the hands of accused antiquities smuggler, the late Douglas Latchford, before ultimately landing in private collections.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From Greece, with its looted Elgin Marbles displayed in London’s British Museum, to Nigeria’s Benin Bronzes, also stolen by the British Empire in 1897 and distributed around the world, many countries, particularly those once subjugated under colonial rule, are demanding their cultural property back. And Cambodia is no exception.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/15/136210ac-1241-4085-9509-f2d20d25ce47_f60200c9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Over the past decade or more, this Southeast Asian nation has made a concerted effort to track down and repatriate looted statues, often with the help of the US government, which signed a landmark cultural property agreement with Cambodia in 2003.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many individuals have been involved in the fight, notably American lawyer Bradley Gordon and his team of Cambodian researchers and archaeologists. Davis, however, has been there from the beginning, battling auction houses and assisting the Royal Government of Cambodia, especially in recovering one particular statue stolen from Koh Ker, of the Duryodhana, a mythic warrior from the Hindu epic the Mahabharata.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The return of this particular piece would lead to the discovery of an international smuggling ring involving tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Cambodian relics, allegedly run by Latchford, who has emerged as one of the biggest suspected antiquities smugglers in the region.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/15/831123a8-a880-4959-9bb3-e7842e2cda30_0b7d8e58.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Davis’ efforts would earn her the Royal Order of Sahametrei, the equivalent of a Cambodian knighthood, in 2015. A year earlier, in an article in The Diplomat, veteran Cambodia-based journalist Luke Hunt dubbed her “Indiana Jane”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Macon, Georgia, the United States, 1996</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A demure 13-year-old middle-schooler stuffed her hand into a hat, stirred the assorted pieces of paper, pulled one out and stared at the single word written on it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Kampuchea!?” exclaimed young Tess Davis in her southern drawl. She had never heard of the word, and scrambled to look it up in an encyclopaedia with the help of her teacher. Discovering it was the ancient name of modern-day Cambodia, it was now the country assigned to her for a year-long research project.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Davis had longed to explore the secrets of the past, and her first dive into Cambodia would lead her to a scholarship to Boston University, home to the only independent archaeology department in the country at the time.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘It can be pretty horrifying’: how Cambodia’s land grabs are ruining lives</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ricardo Elia, associate professor of archaeology at the university, told me in January that he recalls Davis giving a presentation at a national archaeology conference as an undergraduate and holding the room enraptured, at which point he “knew this kid was a star”, and that Davis was “the type of student you see once every 10 years”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In November 2003, almost a decade after turning in her fateful middle-school project, Davis attended a guest lecture at Boston University given by visiting archaeologist Dougald O’Reilly, who at the time was teaching archaeology at the Royal University of Fine Arts in Phnom Penh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/15/3c7ebadb-55da-44ed-9676-4215cce4521c_b2b82320.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was at that institution that the Canadian-born scholar founded Heritage Watch, a project dedicated to the preservation of cultural heritage. Davis approached him after the lecture, and eventually applied for a position in this new organisation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As O’Reilly told me in November 2022, Davis nailed the interview, and moved to Phnom Penh, where he put her in charge of numerous projects, including writing a Khmer children’s book, heading into communities to teach about heritage theft, and developing the Database of Historical and Archaeological Regulations for the Management of Antiquities (DHARMA), focused on Cambodian and other Southeast Asian countries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After the 2005 visit to Koh Ker, along with other temple sites such as Preah Khan Kompong Svay, an equally isolated – and completely ransacked – site 47km (29 miles) southeast of Koh Ker, what struck Davis most was the social impact of antiquities trafficking.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/15/1d9b70d9-d324-4516-98d6-33f7ee5510ee_435742c5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As she explained to me in October 2022, “Koh Ker should be a very rich community today. Tourists should be coming from all over the world to go there and it’s never going to happen because you can’t put these pieces back now.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Without doubt, the most well known and visited destination in Cambodia is Angkor Wat, where in 2022, annual revenue from ticket sales was US$11.5 million. At its pre-pandemic peak, in 2018, Angkor Wat drew 2.5 million visitors who spent US$116 million on tickets alone. Koh Ker, meanwhile, made US$90,450 from ticket sales in 2022.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not only are the temple statues and artefacts part of the allure for tourists, these antiquities are considered living spirits by Cambodians, and during Davis’ time at Heritage Watch, in conversations with journalists, archaeologists and cultural heritage experts about them being looted and sold, often in hushed tones, one name kept on coming up – Douglas Latchford.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Bangkok, Thailand, 1955</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There’s another one at the shop where I bought this,” said François Duhau de Bérenx, a stalwart of Bangkok’s expatriate community in the 1950s. He had noticed his dinner guest, a British sales manager called Douglas Latchford, admiring a 24-inch stone torso on the floor of Bérenx’s home in the Thai capital.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The French aristocrat probably didn’t think much of his comment at the time, but that stone torso, and the promise of another one like it, would set Latchford on the path to becoming a prolific collector, and allegedly, equally invested looter and smuggler of Cambodian cultural property.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an interview with London’s Apollo magazine in 2008, Latchford described approaching his bank manager for a loan the day after the dinner party, then heading to Bangkok’s Woeng Nakhon Khasem, the “thieves market” – a bustling thoroughfare known for its stolen goods – and buying an identical piece to the one in Bérenx’s house for about US$700, roughly US$8,000 today.</p>Museums are at the top of the food chain in the art world.

He would reveal in his 2008 book, Khmer Gold, that the statue at Bérenx’s house “had an immediate effect on me that would change my life. I was smitten and from then on could think of nothing but this wonderful torso”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Born on October 15, 1931, in British Bombay, Latchford was fascinated with lost jungle temples and drawn, like countless other children of the Raj, to the works of Rudyard Kipling, with their exotic settings, adventurous characters and colonial sensibilities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After attending a British boarding school, he returned to India following independence, in 1947, and, in 1955, moved to the Thai capital.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As reported in the Bangkok Post in 2010, Latchford worked as a general manager for a large British import company called the Anglo-Thai Corporation, which sold pharmaceuticals, chemicals and an array of other imported goods.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other details of Latchford’s ascent in the 1950s and ’60s are sparse, but recent interviews in the “Dynamite Doug” Project Brazen podcast suggest that while he worked for Anglo-Thai, Latchford cultivated a side hustle in acquiring Cambodian and Thai antiquities, and set up an antique shop in Bangkok.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/15/dfcfeb7b-ae3e-44a3-a427-59768ec789a1_f478134f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also developed a relationship with London auction house Spink & Son, and as he amassed his collection, arbitraged his way to healthy profits, especially as American influence in the region began to rise, bringing interest from Western collectors for Southeast Asian art.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also became entrenched in Thai society, taking a Thai name, Pakpong Kriangsak, and marrying a Thai woman.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As Latchford’s profits accumulated, he expanded his operation and buried the proceeds of his alleged looting in other investments.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was intimated in an investigative report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), published in The Washington Post, in October 2021, that Latchford laundered some of his alleged ill-gotten gains in luxury real estate through an offshore company.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Open-source documents provided to me in May by former Goldman Sachs executive turned independent art scholar Angela Chiu show that Latchford registered an offshore corporation in Hong Kong, Fleetwing Estates, in 1976.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As Chiu explained to me, this likely allowed him to conceal his assets from government authorities, since Hong Kong requires almost no financial disclosure by private companies.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong crowned world’s freest economy again in global rankings</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a Hong Kong company, Fleetwing owned, at various times, multiple flats at 12 Charles Street and a penthouse at 1 Carlos Place, both in London’s ultra-exclusive Mayfair area. Land Registry data and title deeds show that flat 1 at 12 Charles Street, owned by Latchford and subsequently his daughter, Julia, sold for £4.6 million (US$5.8 million) in 2019.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The ICIJ, whose investigation was based on the Pandora Papers leak, reported that Latchford had created the Skanda Trust, another offshore vehicle registered in Jersey in the Channel Islands, where antiquities he owned were held, sheltered from government investigation. The Skanda Trust took over control of Fleetwing in 2011.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As an established collector by the 2000s, Latchford cultivated relationships with the National Museum of Cambodia, and with museums worldwide by lending, selling and donating Khmer statues to them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As Chiu, with a PhD in Thai Buddhist art history and literature, explained in an email in December 2022, “Museums are at the top of the food chain in the art world. When a museum displays an artwork, the object is legitimised and authenticated. A dealer’s reputation is enhanced whenever a museum accepts one of their objects.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/15/ef113618-f100-48ca-a732-a8208b8feaa8_0a9315b8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to US prosecutors, Latchford also allegedly provided stolen Khmer pieces to prestigious auction houses like Spink & Son as well as prominent art dealers such as Manhattan-based Nancy Wiener, who pleaded guilty to felony charges of criminal possession of stolen property and conspiracy in 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Through these channels Latchford’s looted antiquities would surface on the international art market and make their way to museums or private collections.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He enhanced his public image as an expert in Khmer antiquities when he wrote and self-published, alongside art scholar Emma Bunker, three glossy books between 2004 and 2011: Adoration and Glory, Khmer Gold and Khmer Bronzes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As reported by Sam Tabachnik in The Denver Post in March, the late Bunker was a Denver-based expert in Khmer art with a master’s in fine arts from New York University, and held a visiting professorship at Colorado College.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She became acquainted with Latchford in the 1970s and they developed a close personal and working relationship. Bunker often vouched for Latchford, her standing in the art community serving to burnish Latchford’s reputation, and it is suspected that Bunker was complicit in many of Latchford’s alleged misdeeds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Personal emails sent from Bunker and obtained by Tabachnik imply that she was complicit in altering provenance or the historical records attached to particular antiquities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bunker died in February 2021, without issuing any statement in regard to these allegations.</p>If pillaged sites are not the source of Sotheby’s auctions of Khmer artefacts, then what is? Unless these pieces are forgeries, they simply must have come from archaeological sites at some point in their history2011 research paper by Tess Davis<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All three volumes feature pieces from Latchford’s private collection, as well as those of others. Chiu points out that, in seeking legitimacy, “publication of artworks was another tactic. In the art market, publication generally increases the pricing of an artwork, even if the publication is of low quality; thus the three [books] were very valuable to his marketing efforts”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Latchford was also, oddly enough, a leading figure in the bodybuilding world, assuming the position of president of the Thailand Bodybuilding Association from the early 2000s. He even had a competition named after himself, the Latchford Classic, in Bangkok.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The local gossip was that his proximity to bodybuilders provided Latchford with muscled young men for protection and intimidation. Alan Parkhouse, a former managing editor of The Phnom Penh Post who interviewed Latchford in 2010, told me in a series of email exchanges in May that “Latchford employed bodybuilders as his security guards at the apartment building he owned”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When asked if he thought Latchford had used violent means to suppress unwanted probing, as was rumoured, he said, “Latchford could certainly be intimidating, but I never heard of anyone getting roughed up”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The unravelling of Latchford’s alleged smuggling network began in 2007, when stone conservator Simon Warrack, working for a German organisation, noticed two sets of stone feet on the ground outside the Prasat Chen temple at Koh Ker, one of the temples Davis and O’Reilly were investigating in 2005. (Davis admits in her own writing for Bostonia magazine in 2014, that on the trip with O’Reilly, she had missed seeing these feet.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/15/2cc90408-28be-48ae-bf51-e539540be403_d99c5dc8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Warrack found that one of the sets of feet seemed to match the Dvarapala statue that appeared in Latchford and Bunker’s 2004 book, Adoration and Glory. Warrack then digitally superimposed the statue in the book onto a picture of one set of feet in situ, and they seemed a perfect match.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Warrack traced the missing statue to the Norton Simon Museum, in California, which had called it “the temple wrestler”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Warrack then sent a report to the Unesco office in Cambodia, informing it of the find. In May, I contacted Unesco in Cambodia, which referred me to its 2007 director for clarification of what Unesco’s response was to the report, but I did not receive a reply.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2009, Eric Bourdonneau, French archaeologist and lecturer at the French School of Asian Studies, based in Paris but founded in Saigon, visited Koh Ker, and, like Warrack, noted the same two sets of stone feet located at the western entrance of the Prasat Chen temple.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He concluded that the second set of feet belonged to a partner statue, the Duryodhana. This meant that the Norton Simon piece, “the temple wrestler”, was actually Bhima, one of the five brothers central to the Mahabharata.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The totem pole that became a crumbling symbol of China-Canada relations</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bhima, who was known for his strength and mastery of the mace, had been locked in battle with his bitter foe, Duryodhana, at the Prasat Chen temple in Koh Ker.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hindu iconography in Khmer temple structures is nearly ubiquitous, being as it was the dominant religion during the Khmer empire, which began in AD802.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hinduism and Buddhism slowly diffused through pre-Khmer Cambodia via what is referred to by historians as the Indianisation of Southeast Asia, a result of centuries of trade with and exposure to Indian merchants, since Cambodia lay at the midpoint of the maritime trade route between India and China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jason Felch, co-author with then-Los Angeles Times colleague Ralph Frammolino of the 2011 book Chasing Aphrodite: The Hunt for Looted Antiquities at the World’s Richest Museum, interviewed Bourdonneau in 2014 for his Chasing Aphrodite blog.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the exchange, Bourdonneau revealed that the footless Duryodhana’s location remained a mystery until 2011, when a collector accidentally informed him of a “Koh Ker-style” statue about to go to auction by Sotheby’s in March of that year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Duryodhana featured on the cover of the sales catalogue had an estimated price of US$2 million to US$3 million.

But as it turns out, her 2011 research paper, published on July 11, just a few months after the scheduled auction, in the US-based peer-reviewed journal Crime, Law and Social Change, analysed all the Sotheby’s catalogues related to South Asian art from 1988 to 2010, and found that more than 70 per cent of the 377 lots of the house’s Khmer antiquities had no provenance or history of ownership.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/15/25bece52-96fd-4b4c-9f85-c309bfdc004a_abdedaef.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If that were not damning enough, sales of these items on the international market were shown to skyrocket during periods of instability in Cambodia, such as at the end of the Vietnamese occupation, in 1989, and the Khmer Rouge surrender, in 1998, further suggesting they were illegally taken.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As Davis states in her conclusion, “If the countless antiquities plundered from the country have not ended up on the international art market, where have they gone?

On August 11, 2011, Davis, who was in Phnom Penh at the time, opened a copy of the Cambodia Daily and was shocked to see the headline: “Sotheby’s traded hundreds of looted artefacts, study says.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In late August, just over two weeks since the Cambodia Daily piece went to print, a look of dismay came over Davis’ face as she gazed at a letter with the Sotheby’s logo in the left corner.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The letter, from Jane Levine, senior vice-president and worldwide compliance director at Sotheby’s, read: “A private apology is hardly sufficient to repair the damage done by your paper; your paper lacks conceptual rigour, is riddled with false statements and inaccuracies, and reaches a false conclusion. It should be withdrawn.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/15/dffafb3c-6cd5-4788-b352-b9a3e446b51a_e3245dee.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This was just the first of Sotheby’s’ numerous attempts to pressure Davis into retracting her research, which she revealed to me in a series of emails from Levine, who had previously been employed as a US attorney in the Southern District of New York prosecuting art fraud.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As they continued to lash out over the subsequent months, Davis contacted a colleague, Marc Masurovsky, an expert in Nazi-looted art.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a video interview with Masurovsky in April, he told me he recalls offering his support at the time saying, “No offence, Tess, but no one who buys these antiquities is reading your research paper.

According to The New York Times, in October 2012, the Lion identified 33 items from the Met that he personally plundered and sent up the trafficking chain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/15/a7d8db99-78f4-40da-abed-2e37c004e7dd_e2c75863.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As reported by Mashberg, in The New York Times in November 2021, “The authorities have become convinced, in part, by Toek Tik’s ability to pinpoint the exact location of feet, bases and other remnants of statuary he says he once stole.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The interview with Toek Tik was one of dozens that Davis and her research partners, Simon Mackenzie and Thanaren Than, would conduct with villagers, looters, middlemen and collectors over three months in the summer of 2013, traversing Cambodia and Thailand deciphering how objects were looted and moved to personal collections, or laundered and sold by elite auction houses in New York and London.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Davis and Mackenzie would publish these findings in 2014, in a landmark paper, “Anatomy of a Statue Trafficking Network”, in the peer-reviewed British Journal of Criminology.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A breakthrough came on December 13, 2013.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In settlement court papers filed on that day, Sotheby’s had determined that “further litigation of this action would be burdensome and would require disputed resolution of factual issues and issues of US, Cambodian, French and other law” and that “Sotheby’s and Ms Ruspoli have voluntarily determined, in the interest of promoting cooperation and collaboration with respect to cultural heritage, to arrange for the statue to be transferred to the kingdom of Cambodia.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Phnom Penh, Cambodia, June 14, 2014</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Traditional Cambodian dancers moved gracefully as the Duryodhana and Bhima were showered with jasmine blossoms. Davis, Bourdonneau, Warrack and Lemaistre looked on as the gods were welcomed home by the deputy prime minister of Cambodia, Hor Namhong, and other dignitaries. It had been many years, but the great warriors had finally returned.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As Davis explains in the 2014 documentary The Stolen Warriors, “It’s not just about art, it’s more important than that, this is one chance for us to right just one of the many, many wrongs that have happened to Cambodia.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Duryodhana case placed Latchford squarely on the radar of US investigators. By 2018, four years after the warriors had been returned to Cambodia, the US government, with Davis as a consultant, had collected enough evidence to indict Latchford for wire fraud.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Seemingly, every Khmer antiquity had his fingerprints on it. By some estimates, he was suspected of being the greatest plunderer of cultural heritage in the past century. Latchford always denied these allegations.</p>I regret what I did and I want the gods to come homeReformed looter Toek Tik<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a rare interview in The Stolen Warriors, Latchford said, referring to the prosecutors, “Their imagination has gone wild. They’ve seen too many Indiana Jones films. As far as I know there is no such thing as a smuggling network, and I certainly don’t belong to any smuggling network.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Latchford was 88 years old when he died in Bangkok on August 2, 2020, before he could stand trial. His daughter, Julia, pledged Cambodia his private collection and, in some respects, attempted to rectify her father’s purported misdeeds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">US investigators and Gordon even gained momentum post-Duryodhana. A major collection was traced back to Netscape co-founder James Clark.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unaware of the dubious provenance and trusting Latchford, Clark amassed a significant collection, estimated to be worth US$35 million. This was voluntarily returned and in August 2022, Davis and several officials gathered in New York for the restitution ceremony before the items were returned to Cambodia in March this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Toek Tik died in Cambodia from pancreatic cancer in 2021, but not before changing the narrative of his legacy by working with Cambodian and US officials to track down objects he had looted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an interview with The New York Times in 2021, he said, through a translator, “I regret what I did and I want the gods to come home.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOpaann12nsqKw0miYq6yZmLmme5JraW1qYG58qbvWZqqtmaSqsm64zqirnpxdmK6urs6doJqmXamyrrzLnmSrnaaarq2xw2atmqukYsCuwcago6Kml2K7psDWqKmkZZSarq21zaBkrKyfobKvecKuo62topa5bq3RrZyfmZOpwA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-statue-looted-cambodian-temple-revealed-vast-smuggling-network-dealing-stolen-cultural-artefacts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-statue-looted-cambodian-temple-revealed-vast-smuggling-network-dealing-stolen-cultural-artefacts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-statue-looted-cambodian-temple-revealed-vast-smuggling-network-dealing-stolen-cultural-artefacts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-statue-looted-cambodian-temple-revealed-vast-smuggling-network-dealing-stolen-cultural-artefacts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-statue-looted-cambodian-temple-revealed-vast-smuggling-network-dealing-stolen-cultural-artefacts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-statue-looted-cambodian-temple-revealed-vast-smuggling-network-dealing-stolen-cultural-artefacts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./iceland-in-august.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./iceland-in-august.html>Iceland in August Chris Coyier</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./654854d046163fb11e8b45a1-html.html>Asesinan a periodista cuando transmita en vivo en Filipinas</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./654854d046163fb11e8b45a1-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
