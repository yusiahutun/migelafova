While there was audience criticizing her tears as fake, she said that those were all the pain she had to go through. The young lady at that time was going through a massive divorce after her 10-year long husband started dating her cousin. It was a big heartbreak for her. After that, she had to raise&nbsp;her children alone and had a hard time in those days.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Peter McMahon Wiki: Age, Net Worth, Family </a><a href=# rel=follow>and</a><a href=# rel=follow> Dana Perino</a></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>After the hard times, she had found her love and father for her children in Shelby Lowry.

It was clear that the couple was struggling over their relationship. Iyanla brought up that Neffe used to hit her husband.

She said though they are sisters, they do not have the same life. Keyshia has earned her money with her hard work, so it is not necessary to share her fortune with her sister. They are all grown up, and everyone is responsible for themselves.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>The reality star also clarified that Keyshia also did not like the way her sister and mother did the reality show The Frankie and Neffe Show.
