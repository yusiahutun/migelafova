Now that I am working much less, I prefer to stay up at night, reading or watching TV, and get up later. I wear cotton pajama pants and a T-shirt to sleep. In the morning I put on a blue terry robe from Pratesi. I like to get up immediately and have my breakfast at a small folding table. My breakfast is rather simple, as are all other meals: berries and Greek yogurt and tea, and a cup of hot water with lemon. People believe I have huge, rich banquets all the time. It's just the opposite, as I hate rich food, and I follow a rather strict regime. My room in Wideville [outside Paris] is enormous, so walking to the different places in the room is already a good morning exercise. I hate baths; instead I just take a shower. I use L'Occitane bath oil and a mild shampoo, Maple Wash, from a small Italian company, Philip Martin's.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>10:45 A.M.</strong> Getting ready is long. I start to get dressed, which takes more than one hour, but there are calls in the middle and playing with my dogs. I always wear Caraceni, my tailors in Rome, mostly jackets with light-colored pants. I own 300 suits from them, but I keep ordering again and again. Sometimes I wear Ralph Lauren. My shoes are Jo from the 1930s hn Lobb, Berluti, or alligator shoes made to measure in Naples. My cologne is Jo Malone's Dark Amber. My first telephone call is usually to Giancarlo [Giammetti]: "How are you? Did you sleep well?" That kind of conversation. I make two or three calls during my preparation to the most important people in my life. Giancarlo and I have built this family of friends—they are the only ones who have daily contact with me. I like to call them many times a day; that way I feel closer to them even if they are not with me. But I hate long calls. I don't use the computer, fax, e-mail, or text messaging. I don't read about fashion, and my only information comes from TV—CNN or Italian news channels. I read an Italian newspaper, but they bore me because they just talk about politics and scandals in politics. I prefer TV.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>12:30 P.M</strong>. I do a tour, weather permitting, of the gardens, followed by my six pugs: Mary, Maude, Milton, Monty, Molly, and Margot. It all started with Maggie, their mother; since then I've loved the sound of names with M.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>1:45 P.M.</strong> Lunch is mostly in the jardin d'hiver, with a great view of the gardens. I am alone or with an associate or a friend, usually Giancarlo or Bruce [Hoeksema]. I try to eat a simple diet: no sugar, no milk, no dairy except goat cheese, no gluten pasta, Bio Rice, no meat, some fish (not the ones with mercury), vegetables, no potatoes, no bread except rice crackers or grissini, one glass of red wine, sugarless sherbet, all sweets made with almond milk and xylitol sweetener, and one coffee a day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>3:00 P.M.</strong> In the afternoon, if I don't have meetings in town, I go to the office of the [house's] property and go through all the matters of keeping this house running, especially the gardens and the trees. Or I work on my virtual museum, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.valentinogaravanimuseum.com// data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=valentinogaravanimuseum.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">valentinogaravanimuseum.com</a>. For me, it has been the first major contact with modern technology and the digital world, though I still cannot really move through the Web site without help. Now we are focused on further developing the site, which is a new, easier way to enter the museum. You can see gowns from my collections, read weekly stories, and catch Carlos Souza's [Valentino's longtime PR chief] "Instaglams" of the month. What do I collect? Ask me what I don't collect! I am maniacal about china—I know all the ones I own, and I personally choose them for dinner. I think I own more than 100 different sets. I love the antique sets, like the Meissen or the Russian, and some from P.K. Silesia, a German company, from the 1930s. Glassware is much simpler, clear, mostly from Nason Moretti in Venice. If I go to Paris for shopping, it's mostly at antiques stores—I love Galerie J. Kugel and Galerie Camoin Demachy. Maybe I'll pass by Galignani to buy a book. I love biographies, especially the ones of the great kings and queens or of a great personality of our times. Now I'm reading a long biography of Cesare Borgia because I love The Borgias on TV. Or maybe I go to see a friend for tea. If I stay in Wideville, I spend most of my time in my archives, a kind of small museum, full of memorabilia; and I work on some new project for the stage or just go through books and letters. 5:00 P.M. Four times a week I have Pilates class. My sports outfits are from Nike.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>7:00 P.M.</strong> After the TV news it's time to change for dinner. I put on something more casual if I am by myself, a sweater from Malo and pants from Brunello Cucinelli or a knit shirt, and comfortable slippers from Jimmy Choo or Belgian shoes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>8:30 P.M.</strong> It's now time for dinner. If I have a few friends over, I will have a table set in the big dining room; otherwise I eat by myself in a smaller dining room. Never in front of a TV. Even if I'm alone, I like to be at a proper table with nice china and good food. The diet is even lighter than lunch: never pasta at night, some fish and vegetables, and a glass of Brunello di Montalcino.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>9:30 P.M.</strong> I go in the media room, where I can watch an old movie, or if somebody knows how to use it, Apple TV, so we can get the latest movies. I love black-and-white movies from the 1940s and '50s, mostly American ones. My favorite is Some Like It Hot. I like the French Nouvelle Vague too. Today I like more and more TV shows. Of course Downton Abbey was a masterpiece, but I also like Homeland. I love music that is kind of soft, like Coldplay and the great operas.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>12:00 A.M.</strong> I go to my room, and after the usual two or three phone calls to wish goodnights, I watch a bit of news or I read. The bedsheets are made of linen, exclusively white, and have my initials embroidered on the corner of each pillow. They are made just for me by a lovely lady in Rome. I sleep with two large pillows and one smaller, always with an open window. My bedsheets are, of course, ironed every morning and every night. Only Mary, the youngest pug, sleeps with me, on her pillow on the bed. She is quiet until 8 A.M., then she starts to worry if her food does not arrive. 2:00 A.M. I switch off the lights.</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Garavani with Linda Evangelista in Harper's Bazaar, December 2003, photographed by Jean-Paul Goude</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWiclai2qLrEq6pomWFlfXZ7kW1koaelp8Buw8itn2aukaGyr8DIp6ZmaGlmgHA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f24-hours-with-valentino-0913.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f24-hours-with-valentino-0913.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f24-hours-with-valentino-0913.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f24-hours-with-valentino-0913.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f24-hours-with-valentino-0913.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f24-hours-with-valentino-0913.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./9-fascinating-facts-about-stade-geoffroy-guichard.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./9-fascinating-facts-about-stade-geoffroy-guichard.html>9 Fascinating Facts About Stade Geoffroy-Guichard</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./2022-was-the-coldest-start-to-the-casi-st-patricks-day-race.html>2022 was the coldest start to the CASI St. Patricks Day Race!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./2022-was-the-coldest-start-to-the-casi-st-patricks-day-race.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
