Here’s how much she is worth.</strong></p><p>Rock music Hall of Famer Tina Turner is a music industry legend. The “Poor Fool” singer has made her mark in history with multiple top-charting albums and awards to her name.&nbsp;</p><p>Turner started her music career in the 1950s, performing with her then-husband Ike Turner. The duo became known as “Ike and Tina Turner Revue,” and they succeeded with live performances.</p><p>In 1960 when a singer refused to show for a Kings of Rhythm recording session, Turner seized the opportunity. She sang the lead on a track titled “A Fool in Love,” which became a huge R&B hit.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/27/cc/18/27cc18a5bdd81202102ca1b1aca7b3e1.jpg><p>The group became so popular in 1969 they <a href=#>toured </a>as the opening act for the “Rolling Stones.” In 1971 the group released the album “Workin’ Together,” which featured the song”Proud Mary.” The song reached the top five of the U.S charts and even earned the duo their first Grammy Award.&nbsp;</p><p>However, during the latter part of the 1970s, things deteriorated between Turner and her husband, leaving him to start on her own. As a result, her solo career progressed slowly, but she continued to perform in low-profile shows.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, her career emerged again in 1983 when she released a remake of Al Green’s song “Let’s Stay Together.” The song reached the top five on the US R&B charts and the top ten in U.K pop.&nbsp;</p><p>The following year she released her much anticipated solo album “Private Dancer.” The album sold 20 million copies and won her four Grammy Awards.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, Turner has released many albums with top-charting songs and has also won countless awards.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=TINA_TURNERS_NET_WORTH></span><strong>TINA TURNER’S NET WORTH</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Turner’s meteoric rise to fame, which started in 1983, continued for the preceding three decades. Since the “Private Dancer” album sold 20 million copies, she has sold over 200 million records worldwide.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/46/d1/c0/46d1c0b18a6aa09e65fa30417d25ab7b.jpg><p>The iconic musician made a name for herself as a powerful vocalist with a long career at the top. She has won 12 Grammy awards in total, including three Grammy Hall of Fame awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement.</p><p>Although she retired from performing in 2009, Turner’s music royalties still bring in a ton of money for the musician. In 2021, she sold hee music, likeness, and image rights to BMG Rights Management for $50 million.<a href=#> According to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Tina Turner’s net worth is a whopping $250 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ike_Took_Her_to_a_Live_Sex_Show_After_Their_Wedding></span><strong>Ike Took Her to a Live Sex Show After Their Wedding</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2018 decades after divorcing her first husband, Ike Turner gave an insight into what her marriage to the musician was like. According to Turner, she only married Ike because she was scared to reject his marriage proposal.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/a0/d2/5d/a0d25d2fe927387f3a7a7c0f400e0232.jpg><p>Ike discovered her and made her the singer of his “Kings of Rhythm” band, so she felt obligated to marry him. However, he drove her across the Mexican border to Tijuana instead of having a fancy wedding.</p><p>Afterward, he forced her to watch a live sex show on the night of their wedding. She <a href=#>said</a>:</p><p><strong>“People can’t imagine the kind of man he was – a man who takes his brand new wife to a live, pornographic sex show right after their marriage ceremony.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>However, when they returned to Los Angeles, she had to pretend like a happy young bride. Although the couple enjoyed success, their relationship lasted for only 14 years.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Turner_has_a_Guinness_World_Record></span><strong>Turner has a Guinness World Record.&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many artists might have sold as many records as Tina Turner, but she has what others don’t; a world record. The musician <a href=#>holds </a>the Guinness World Record for selling more concert tickets than any other solo performer in history.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, with her statistics of selling more than 200 million records worldwide, she is one of the biggest selling female artists in history. Turner is an inspiration to many upcoming males and female contemporary rock and pop artists.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Turners_First_Husband_Ike_Abused_Her></span><strong>Turner’s First Husband Ike Abused Her&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Turner and her first husband Ike enjoyed success as artists, their marriage was in chaos most of the time. Years after their separation, she revealed that Ike was emotionally and physically <a href=#>abusive </a>to her.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/4e/cf/d5/4ecfd5b1f03566bde7626470c7ecc91f.jpg><p>In Ike’s biography, he acknowledged some of his abuse towards Turner.&nbsp; He <a href=#>noted</a>:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“Sure I’ve slapped Tina. There have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. But I never beat her.”</strong></p><p>After Turner left the marriage in 1976, she <a href=#>struggled </a>to leave her hellish experience behind. During interviews, people constantly asked her about her ex-husband, although she disliked talking about him.</p><p>The singer’s current husband, Erwin Bach, who she married after Ike, disclosed Turner still has nightmares about that time. According to him, the singer is forced to re-live the experience whenever she is asked a question about it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Turner_Has_a_Documentary_About_Her_Life></span><strong>Turner Has a Documentary About Her Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Like many superstar athletes, renowned celebrities, and figures, Turner has released a documentary to tell fans about her life and career. The HBO documentary titled “Tina” <a href=#>explores </a>the nuances, hardships, trauma, and abuse she experienced.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The documentary features clips of the musician detailing her abuse at the hands of Ike, her first husband. Turner also touched on the abuse she witnessed as a child and the financial abuse she suffered.</p><p>The series, divided into five parts, gives an in-depth insight into the icon’s life and past. It features archival footage and Turner’s first-hand tale about most issues.&nbsp;</p><p>The “HBO” series debuted on March 27, 2021, to widespread critical acclaim. But unfortunately, it also exposed fans to the horror Turner had to deal with while supplying the world with world-class music records.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKmt02agrGWknruiedOuqaedoqh6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqe71Ktkn5mTqcBurcGorK1lpJ2ybr%2FIp56eql8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-tina-turners-net-worth-four-facts-about-the-singer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-tina-turners-net-worth-four-facts-about-the-singer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-tina-turners-net-worth-four-facts-about-the-singer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-tina-turners-net-worth-four-facts-about-the-singer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-tina-turners-net-worth-four-facts-about-the-singer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-tina-turners-net-worth-four-facts-about-the-singer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./zoe-saldana-mgemi-ballet-flat-trend-7098323.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./zoe-saldana-mgemi-ballet-flat-trend-7098323.html>Zoe Saldaa Wore M.Gemi Ballet Flats With tica Jeans</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-10-free-nail-polish.html>What Is 10-Free Nail Polish?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-is-10-free-nail-polish.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
