Rumors the Duchess was on the cusp of a new lucrative deal to help her and <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> have been flat-out denied.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>The blow is even more brutal considering it could have been a new venture for the 42-year-old after the multi-million deal with <a href=#>Spotify</a> appeared to have ended so badly. Meghan herself has moved on, officially backing out of a copyright claim to Archetypes earlier this year. She isn’t one to dwell. But the new rejection could be painting a bigger picture for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-s-make-or-break-in-hollywood-doesn-t-cut-it>Meghan’s ‘make or break’ in Hollywood doesn’t cut it</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1235516719-1024x683.jpg><p>Recently, media outlets have been reporting the mom-of-two was nearing the end to signing a huge deal with Amazon’s Audible. It was buzzed as the ‘make or break’ of her <a href=#>Hollywood</a> career.</p><p>A source revealed to Closer UK, she was happy with the new venture after Spotify ended in June.</p><p>“Word of mouth is spreading that it will lead to a huge pay out – even bigger than the millions Spotify splashed out – and Meghan is thrilled that she’ll be in the company of Michelle and Barack Obama (who signed with Audible last year),” the source said.</p><p>“Meghan seems very confident at the moment, but the reality is that she’s been in a pretty desperate spot. Losing the Spotify deal was a massive blow. She’s been pretty lost since but this deal could turn everything around.”</p><p>But, Audible has come out to completely deny the <a href=# rel=nofollow>claims</a>.</p><p>They said: “There is no truth to the reports, and Audible is not in negotiations with Meghan Markle.”</p><p>So where does that leave Meg now?</p><p>Her Spotify deal only led to one 12-episode podcast series, shorter than other <a href=#>celebrity</a> and high-profile contracts. The contract was agreed in late 2020, the same year they decided to leave the UK, but it took two-and-a-half years for it to be brought to life, in August 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-s-recent-rejection-and-their-lucrative-deals>Meghan Markle’s recent ‘rejection’ and their lucrative deals</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-13.57.19-1024x517.png><p>Harry alleged his dad <a href=#>King Charles</a> cut them off financially when the couple sat down with celebrity pal Oprah Winfrey in 2021. With the remaining money left to him in his mother’s will, they purchased their <a href=#>Montecito mansion in the star-studded neighborhood</a> of LA. They’ve since changed trajectory to ensure they’re still bringing home the bacon. They do have two children together, <a href=#>Archie</a> and Lilibet.</p><p>The couple isn’t shy from signing huge deals worth millions and millions of dollars. Their Spotify contract, for Meghan’s podcast Archetypes, was said to have earned them $20m. The <a href=#>Netflix</a> contract, which they signed straight away after hanging up their royal robes, was rumored to bring in $100m. Harry then signed on the dotted line with Penguin Random House for a four-book deal. It’s said it likely he had an advance of up to $40m.</p><p>Since then, Prince Harry brought out his bombshell memoir Spare, which detailed all parts of his life. Before and after meeting Meghan, the death of his mother <a href=#>Princess Diana</a> and rifts in the royal family were key focal points. But what is he going to talk about in the other four books? Perhaps Meghan will pick up the pen – or turn on the computer – to write her own memories down. It’s been rumored the Duchess is eying up <a href=#>following in her husband’s footsteps</a> following his success. But if they wait too long, interest could falter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-they-can-t-keep-sweeping-their-past-under-the-carpet>They can’t keep sweeping their past under the carpet</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1199891655-724x1024.jpg><p>Recent news of Meghan and <a href=#>Harry’s brand being considered ‘toxic’</a> by a PR expert, the open opportunities around the Duke and Duchess could be closing in.</p><p>Experts claimed Harry and Meghan have been splitting, in terms of their brand. <a href=#>Prince Harry has been seen solo</a> on numerous occasions. He even had to bring up <a href=#>Meghan Markle’s absence</a> at one of his events. So there could be truth behind the duo separating to keep their individual brands alive. But if that’s the case, what baggage do they carry with them? The heavy feud over the Atlantic with The Firm – Prince William, <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> and Charles – is too big to sweep under the carpet.</p><p>Not only that, but airing the <a href=#>royal family’s dirty laundry</a> is part of their currency. They spoke to Oprah, wrote a book and filmed a Netflix docuseries. All of which was focused solely on their life in the royal family, why they left and allegations thrown at Harry’s family.</p><p>If Meghan is adamant on always being Duchess of Sussex brand-wise – like when she called up a US Senator – it could hinder job opportunities. But, if she clings on with dear life, the toxicity of the plummeting popularity of the royal couple is going to spark more trouble like this in the future.</p><p>If the royal cape is hung up for good, she stands a chance.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2h%2BcLvPoqWip55iuqazx5qlZqWRp7itsdJmo5qslajBbr7Eo5ycrJmku26vzq6jnWWjpa6zt4ytqaitkqGybrLOq2ShnaJirq%2BwjKmpoqaTmnqprdGrsGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fopinion-meghan-markles-latest-rejection-could-spark-trouble-for-her-and-prince-harry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fopinion-meghan-markles-latest-rejection-could-spark-trouble-for-her-and-prince-harry.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fopinion-meghan-markles-latest-rejection-could-spark-trouble-for-her-and-prince-harry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fopinion-meghan-markles-latest-rejection-could-spark-trouble-for-her-and-prince-harry.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fopinion-meghan-markles-latest-rejection-could-spark-trouble-for-her-and-prince-harry.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fopinion-meghan-markles-latest-rejection-could-spark-trouble-for-her-and-prince-harry.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vintage-gucci-watches.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vintage-gucci-watches.html>The best vintage Gucci watches to invest in now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jane-seymour-reacts-trisha-yearwood-honor-reunion-cmt-awards.html>Jane Seymour reacts to Trisha Yearwood honor after reuniting with former co-star at CMT Awards</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jane-seymour-reacts-trisha-yearwood-honor-reunion-cmt-awards.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
