So we took that to the producers and they were like, ‘Well, yeah, you guys know the characters better than anyone else does,’ and so we actually wrote our vows. I wrote Jack's vows and she wrote Elizabeth's, and there's that connection there. You can feel the love between these two characters, and Erin and I, as actors and as friends, have a lot of love for each other, so we really had each other's back through that whole scene."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>With Daniel clarifying loud and clear that he and Erin were&nbsp;just good friends, rumors have since stopped circulating.</p><h2>Silences Gay Allegations With New Girlfriend</h2><p>After Erin, Daniel enjoyed a brief fling with&nbsp;Melisa Miller, a real estate agent. It did help silence the rumors that he was&nbsp;gay, but provided little to no reprieve to his shaky dating life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-603 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Discover:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Bonner Bolton Bio, Girlfriend, Gay, Family</a></p><p>But, then came his girlfriend, now wife, Nadia, in the picture. The actor first gushed about his budding romance in November 2018. At the time, he professed skepticism about revealing their relationship by saying:-</p><p>“We talked about it, the whole social media thing, and where that fits into, where’s the personal life and career life and all that. She’s completely cool with it. I’m the one that’s a little like I’m not sure.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>A month before his confession, the Aussie actor had shared a snap of him and his girlfriend, now wife, Nadia, enjoying a day out. With every passing day, the smitten duo's relationship goes from strength to strength.
