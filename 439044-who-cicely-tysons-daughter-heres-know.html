She was long rumoured not to have a daughter, but shortly before her demise, she shocked everyone by talking about a daughter called Joan in her memoir.

Then, she was married to Kenneth Franklin (married on December 27, 1942).</p><p class=align-left>Cicely met Kenneth Franklin at the church she attended. Kenneth was the reverend's son, making him an eligible bachelor in Cicely's mother's eyes. Their relationship improved after getting to know one another, and they later got pregnant. In her memoir, Cicely wrote the following about the birth of her child:</p>I do recall that Kenneth wanted our child, however unexpected her arrival. I also remember that he never proposed to me. He didn't need to. Our future had been cemented on the evening he'd lifted my dress.<p class=align-left>Unfortunately, Tyson struggled to <a href=#>make the relationship work</a> as she did not think that her then-husband was her soulmate. After Joan turned 2, she filed for divorce and left even before informing Franklin that the marriage was over as she knew that it would break his heart.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/71accc0827e5912c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Olivia Namath: 5 quick facts about Joe Namath's daughter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tyson finalized her divorce to Kenneth in 1956 and pursued her career in acting while raising Joan Tyson alone.
