MailOnline has contacted JawlineMe for comment.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This website reported last month that&nbsp;men in TV shows and adverts are making male viewers at home feel bad about their bodies.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Reality shows and commercials have already been blamed for driving insecurities among young women and leading to a rise in cosmetic surgeries.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But researchers now have growing evidence that men are vulnerable to body envy, too.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Watching toned and muscular models on television is making men wish they were taller, stronger, slimmer and have more defined features, they found in a study.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One expert said the effect is relatively recent as men are more health and body conscious than they used to be, and that there needs to be more research into how men specifically are affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast studied 110 men to look at the effects of watching sexualised versions of men on TV.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They found that while music videos and still photos didn't have much of an effect, seeing fit men on television significantly dented satisfaction with their own bodies.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Our key finding was that viewing idealised depictions of men in television commercials was the only media type to trigger body dissatisfaction, likely due to increased social comparison,' wrote the researchers, led by Dr Kate Mulgrew.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On a scale of one to 10, men's body satisfaction dropped from an average 5.14 to 4.58 after watching about three minutes of advert footage – an 11 per cent drop.</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>CAMPAIGNERS CALL FOR BOOB JOB AND DIET ADVERTS TO BE PULLED FROM LOVE ISLAND SLOTS&nbsp;</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>Adverts for cosmetic surgery and diet supplements should not be shown during Love Island, campaigners said last year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Feminist campaigners <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Level Up</a> called on ITV to ban cosmetic adverts from the show, and were joined by the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS).&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They said the decision to advertise boob jobs and weight-loss drinks during the hit ITV reality show is 'irresponsible' and risks affecting vulnerable people.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Research revealed the show makes nearly half of its viewers more self-conscious about their body and appearance.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The tanned and toned 20-somethings on the show spend most of their time in bikinis and swimwear, which is affecting what people think are normal bodies, experts say.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A poll by Level Up found 40 per cent of young women who watch the show said it affected&nbsp;how they thought&nbsp;about their own body.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And 30 per cent of the 2,246 women in the survey admitted to considering going on a diet after watching the show, and 11 per cent had thought about getting lip fillers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Former president of BAAPS, Nigel Mercer, told MailOnline at the time: 'Love Island and social media put a lot of pressure on people's ideas of what is normal.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There's a problem when these procedures are advertised as "your life will be like Love Island if you have this done".&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'There's no doubt people are enormously influenced by what they see on television.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>ITV said the ads were shown a very small number of times and that the company ensures all advertising sticks to industry rules.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid
