It’s out! It hit shelves on October 27, 2023. It was the biggest announcement of one of the biggest tours in history.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</a>&nbsp;was announced during Taylor’s last date for her US leg of the Eras Tour.</p><p>Swift announced&nbsp;1989 (Taylor’s Version)&nbsp;at her sixth and final&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Eras Tour show</a>&nbsp;of her at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, California, on August 9. “The last time that I was so pleasantly surprised by some stuff that you guys did was when I announced that I was going to be re-recording. That was something that I expected to be just a me thing, just a personal thing. Since I was a teenager, I wanted to own my&nbsp;<a href=#>music</a>,” she said onstage. “The way to do it was to re-record my albums, and the way that you have embraced … that you have celebrated, that you really decided that it was your fight too, and that you were 100 percent behind me … I will never stop thanking you for that.”</p><p>She continued, “And so now, here we are on the last night of the U.S. leg of the Eras tour in the eighth month of the year on the ninth day. You might have noticed there are some new outfits in the show. There’s something that I’ve been planning for a really, really, really ridiculously, embarrassingly long time, and instead of telling you about it, I think I’ll just sort of show you.” Swift then unveiled the cover art and release date for&nbsp;1989 (Taylor’s Version)—October 27, 2023, mark your calendars—before launching into “New Romantics,” a fan-favorite song from the deluxe version of the album. Swift’s former best friend, Karlie Kloss, who was one of her most prominent squad members during the original&nbsp;1989&nbsp;era, also attended the concert.</p><p>1989, which was originally released in 2014. is Swift’s fifth album after 2006’s&nbsp;Taylor Swift, 2008’s&nbsp;Fearless, 2010’s&nbsp;Speak Now, and 2012’s&nbsp;Red. The record was also followed by five more albums: 2017’s&nbsp;Reputation, 2019’s&nbsp;Lover, 2020’s&nbsp;Folklore&nbsp;and&nbsp;Evermore, and 2022’s&nbsp;Midnights. “Swift also announced the news of&nbsp;1989 (Taylor’s Version)&nbsp;on her Instagram.</p><p>“Surprise!! 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is on its way to you The 1989 album changed my life in countless ways, and it fills me with such excitement to announce that my version of it will be out October 27th. To be perfectly honest, this is my most FAVORITE re-record I’ve ever done because the 5 From The Vault tracks are so insane. I can’t believe they were ever left behind. But not for long!”</p><p>According to a 2022&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Reddit</a>&nbsp;thread, each of Taylor Swift’s albums has a color associated with its era—essentially, the imagery of that album’s art, as well as the outfits Swift wore while promoting that album. Her second album,&nbsp;Fearless&nbsp;is yellow; her third album,&nbsp;Speak Now, is purple; her fourth album,&nbsp;Red, is red (obviously); her sixth album,&nbsp;Reputation, is black; her seventh album,&nbsp;Lover, is pink; her eighth album,&nbsp;Folklore, is white; and her ninth album,&nbsp;Evermore,&nbsp;is brown.</p><p>That leaves us with&nbsp;1989, for which the consensus is blue. But why is 1989 blue? Well, aside from the fact that Swift wears a blue sweater on the original&nbsp;1989&nbsp;cover, as well as wore a several blue dresses on the night she announced&nbsp;1989 (Taylor’s Version)&nbsp;at her last Eras Tour concert in Los Angeles in August, blue is also representative of the theme of the album.&nbsp;1989&nbsp;was Swift’s first album after&nbsp;Red, and in many ways, the albums are polar opposites, just like the colors blue and red.</p><p>The Target&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>exclusive vinyl&nbsp;</a>includes 5 previously unreleased songs from The Vault & 1 Bonus Track, a collectible album jacket with unique front and back cover art, 2 Tangerine vinyl discs, and Collectible album sleeves including lyrics and never-before-seen photos.</p><p>You can also get three&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>different types</a>&nbsp;of albums that include, 5 previously unreleased songs from The Vault Collectible, CD album in jewel case with unique front and back cover art, 1 Disc album with unique collectible disc artwork, A collectible lyric booklet with never-before-seen photos (different for each version), 1 of 4 posters, Side 1 includes full-size photograph of Taylor Swift, Side 2 includes a print of the original handwritten lyrics of “Wonderland”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLWmuoyrnKmtpJbBqrvNZquasZykv7R51Z6prKGfo3qku8yeZKitpGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhen-reputation-taylors-version-come-out.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhen-reputation-taylors-version-come-out.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhen-reputation-taylors-version-come-out.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhen-reputation-taylors-version-come-out.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhen-reputation-taylors-version-come-out.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhen-reputation-taylors-version-come-out.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-really-is-lina-de-florias-wiki-married-parents-husband.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-really-is-lina-de-florias-wiki-married-parents-husband.html>Who really is Lina De Florias?
