From calculators that look like robots, to penguin-shaped paper clips, Office Playground has hundreds of ways to lighten up your day. How about a dry-erase board resembling a pad of paper with a big BTW on it. "BTW, your dentist appointment is at 5. BTW, you need more laundry detergent.

But corny in a good way, like simple straightforward silliness. The embodiment of that is the Pull My Finger Farting Pen. You read that right. It's a pen that looks like a finger and when you pull it…flatulence fun follows.

The solution is simple --&nbsp;<a href=#>Ghost Pepper Super Hot Candy Balls</a>. Ranking at about 1 million <a href=#>Scofield Heat Units</a>, they aren't quite as hot as the pepper spray used for defense, but they are still a strong freeloader deterrent.</p><h2 id=catchingfireflies-com><a href=#>CatchingFireflies.com</a></h2><p>Catching Fireflies specializes in, "…desk accessories for women and men that range from the sweet and sublime to some with a small splash of sarcasm."&nbsp;There's no better way to say it.

That's right, egghead as in geeky, and geeky is fun! Next time you write a memo to your boss, do it with the Dissolvo Dissolving Spy Paper. Dissolvo paper looks and feels like normal paper, but completely dissolves along with your words. When your boss brings it to you to ask what it's all about, clutch it and swish it into your coffee. Smile and say, "What memo?" Who's the boss now?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dissolvo-spy-paper-water-soluble-dissolving-paper.jpg><p>Same boss giving you a hard time about your desk mess? Go with it. Get a trash dumpster desk organizer [Broken URL Removed] to put all your crap in. Embrace your inner hoarder. Take pride in pestilence.

Even still, you can order from them on-line. Suck's type of funny is pretty British in nature. It's more of a clever kind of funny. Take, for example, the <a href=#>musical ruler</a>. An ordinary ruler, to be sure, but with some extraordinary markings. The ruler comes with a booklet on how to play it, authored by Dan Wieden. Apparently Dan's a man with more time on his hands than one can measure. <a href=#>He just did it</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/musical_ruler.jpg><p>Got a wing nut in the old office? You know, a person who is lovable but quirky. Why not get your wing nut a <a href=#>wing nut pencil sharpener</a>. The irony won't be lost on them, but even if it is, they'll still have fun with it. Perhaps the most ironic thing about this pencil sharpener is that it works really well. It's easy to hold and turn, more so than most pencil sharpeners. Funny and practical. Just like your office wing nut.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wing-nutpencil-sharpener.jpg><h2 id=amazon-com><a href=#>Amazon.com</a></h2><p>Yep, Amazon is on the list. Is there anything that you can't buy through Amazon now? Anything legal, anyway. Still, with more products under their roof than any on-line retailer, you know you'll find a few funnies for the workplace. It should be mandatory that every manager have a <a href=#>WTF? self-inking stamp</a>.

With a different dog on each flipcard for a different mood, you'll be able to express your current state clearly and concisely. No one can get offended because, hey, cute widdle puppies! Unless they're a cat person. In which case, get the <a href=#>kitty mood cards</a>, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/doggie-moody-cards.jpg><h2 id=let-the-fun-begin>Let the Fun Begin</h2><p>Surely you'll find the right blend of wacky, fun, cute office supplies at these different merchants of merriment.
