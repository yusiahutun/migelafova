More often than not, they contained potent and harsh ingredients, alcohol in particular, that really weren't the best thing to be putting on your skin, especially everyday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Today, you'll find that most skincare brands got hip to the fact that A.) removing makeup at the end of a long night is the last thing any of us want to do and B.) we're even less likely to embark on the tedious process when the makeup remover makes our skin feel stripped and dry. Not to mention, the good feeling we have the next morning about doing the right thing for our skin disappears at the sight of a mascara smudge that somehow evaded last night's cleanse.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you wear minimal makeup on a daily basis or you regularly go for the full glam vibe, you need a strong makeup-removing product that can cut through layers of foundation and waterproof eyeliner, yet doesn't feel strong on skin. Without it, you can bet your bottom dollar that you'll become a magnet for oil, dirt, dead skin, and just plain gunk. Your r pores will soon clog, leading to an acne flare-up, your skin's tone and texture will become rough and dry, possibly even irritation and redness, and overall, skin is simply not looking it's best. Basically, you're giving bacteria an open invitation to take up residence on your face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Now, makeup removers are available in a variety of forms, like oils, balms, and wipes, with formulas that effective cleanse, but also hydrate, exfoliate, and soothe irritation. So while we still find the process somewhat annoying (just because we love to sleep so much), it's infinitely more pleasant — and way healthier for skin — than it was before. Now, there's really no excuse to go to bed with a face full of makeup.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-bioderma-sensibio-h2o-micellar-water-makeup-remover></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bioderma Micellar Water Makeup Remover</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Target Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water Makeup Remover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CFilU4yCxI_8uQ7b91k-A35sV34=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bioderma-sensibio-h2o-micellar-water-makeup-remover-a0f2c48a1cd44acd96e0bce1ebf0fc22.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It gently and effectively removes makeup, leaving the skin soothed and refreshed.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Stubborn waterproof mascara might need a few passes to budge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It feels impossible today, but we vaguely remember a world before micellar water was ubiquitous — and those were dark times, let us tell you. As far as micellar waters (and makeup removers more generally) go, French pharmacy brand Bioderma has served up the best of the best.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This product is a cult-favorite for a reason!” says Koko Slunjski, a Miami-based makeup artist and beauty expert. “It contains micelles, which are tiny oil molecules suspended in water, and this unique composition easily lifts away dirt, oil, and makeup without irritating the skin. It's suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Slunjski isn't the only fan. Several of the experts we spoke to recommended this product for acne-prone skin, since it cleanses impurities without the need for rinsing. Surprisingly, they also praised the lightweight water for skin with eczema, which perhaps isn't so much of a surprise, given that the extra gentle, soothing, lightweight formula was tested by dermatologists throughout development. The result? Skin that just plain feels great, refreshed, and comfortable — not dry or not overly hydrated. Just right.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Micellar water | <strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Micelles, cucumber fruit extract |<strong> Benefits: </strong>Cleansing, soothing, balancing |<strong> Size: </strong>16.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-garnier-skinactive-micellar-cleansing-water-all-in-1-cleanser--makeup-remover></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Garnier Micellar Water</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Garnier SkinActive Micellar Water" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6e7popMESOM8RZ0RjT1Is-Niot0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/garnier-skinactive-micellar-water-7d20d22cd1dc482381b459dde348427d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s suitable for all skin types, including sensitive and acne-prone.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It's not as effective on full glam as we would like.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you use micellar water at all, chances are this is the one you come back to again and again. And who could blame you? It’s affordable, ubiquitous, and just a really great product, which is why Dr. Leah Ansell, a board-certified dermatologist at Treiber Dermatology, is a big fan. “Micellar water is a particularly great makeup remover because it is very gentle, yet effective at removing makeup,” she says. “The micelles within the formula are surfactants, which help break down oils, dirt, makeup, and dead skin cells.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for what makes this particular product so beloved — one bottle is sold every three seconds! — it’s not just the accessible price tag. But rather, it’s the fact that it was tested by both dermatologists and ophthalmologists and deemed safe for all skin types, from the most reactive to the most acneic, as well as tricky spots, like the always troublesome eye area. It’s free of harsh additives, such as fragrance, alcohol, silicones, and sulfates. After each cleanse, the skin feels soft and clean.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this micellar water can easily break down a good amount of makeup, it's not the one to reach for on a full-glam day. The light formula isn't quite tough enough to dissolve a thick, inky cat eye or waterproof mascara.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Micellar water | <strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: Glycerin |<strong> Benefits: </strong>Cleansing, soothing |<strong> Size: </strong>13.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-augustinus-bader-the-cleansing-balm></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Augustinus Bader Cleansing Balm</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Augustinus Bader The Cleansing Balm" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bpJFUXVwbb4MwYjK-BWxMMVcQGo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/augustinus-bader-the-cleansing-balm-9842b2333d0d4206931acf271f6151a1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It feels so nourishing that we couldn't believe it was actually working at first.

It slides all around without any sense of friction, thoroughly washing grime away as it goes. The formula is quite safe, too, without any fragrance, irritants, allergens, or pore-clogging ingredients. Kaitlin Clark, senior beauty commerce editor at InStyle, swears that this unique balm completely rehabilitated her problematic skin. "My skin is extreme in more ways than one," she says. "It's next-level dry from the lingering side effects of Accutane, and highly reactive to almost any halfway potent ingredient, causing my whole face to turn such a raw shade of red that it looks like I'm recovering from an intense laser treatment."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even the most hydrating waters, gels, and wipes were too strong and left her face feeling tight and uncomfortable, and in need serious damage control the next day. "I really didn't have high hopes for this balm that looked like bar soap in a jar, but literally as soon as the waxy texture touched my skin, it instantly melted into a luxurious, milky oil," she says. "It felt indulgent, but I was skeptical it was doing much actual cleansing until I used the accompanying muslin cloth to wipe it all away. My complexion not only looked throughly clean, but also smooth, moisturized, and dare I say, glowing?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the rich balm was a dream for Clark's super dry skin, it may be too dense or heavy for those with oily or combination skin. Given the price, it's best suited for those with parched or dehydrated skin, or saving it for the winter months when everyone's skin feels depleted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Balm | <strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: Sunflower seed oil, coconut oil, grape seed oil, avocado oil, vitamin E, squalane |<strong> Benefits: </strong>Hydrating, nourishing, soothing |<strong> Size: </strong>3.1 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-eye-makeup-shiseido-essentials-instant-eye--lip-makeup-remover></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Eye Makeup</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shiseido Eye & Lip Makeup Remover</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Shiseido Essentials Instant Eye &amp;amp; Lip Makeup Remover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/W4pLIEd2I4zw7kpQUQm3UO_0YvE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shiseido-essentials-instant-eye-lip-makeup-remover-ab4361e2e57f406a8386d01a5f0a3204.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It effectively removes stubborn makeup without stripping the delicate skin around your eyes and lips.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It needs to be thoroughly rinsed, or you may be left with a greasy residue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Eye makeup can be a nightmare to remove: We want our mascaras, glitter eye shadows and eye liners to be completely immobile and unyielding while we're out, but wash away with ease as soon as we're home. Complicating things is the fact that the skin around the eye area is the most delicate on the entire body. It's also thinner and far more sensitive than on the rest of your face, meaning you have to somehow find a product that’s both gentle and super effective.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this may sound basically impossible, Shiseido has thankfully got you covered: This liquid remover is specially formulated to remove eye makeup, as well as deeply pigmented lipstick. And let us tell you: This baby works.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As well as doing a fabulous job at dissolving waterproof mascara and bright red lipstick with ease, this product enables the skin to retain moisture in the most delicate areas of your face, courtesy of the skin strengthening humectant xylitol. It boosts the skin's hydration level by strengthening the barrier itself, so you can go to sleep with makeup-free and hydrated, while that little sugar-based humectant does all the work for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another major pro, as every contact-wearing human knows, is that it won't cause a blinding sting if it gets in your eye. It also won't cause redness or much of an irritation at all. One tiny downside? While this makeup remover is specifically formulated not to leave an oily residue on the skin, some people do find it feels a little greasy —&nbsp;again, it’s really a question of preference here.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid | <strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: Xylitol |<strong> Benefits: </strong>Moisturizing, calming |<strong> Size: </strong>4.2 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wipes-neutrogena-compostable-makeup-remover-cleansing-wipes></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wipes</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Neutrogena Compostable Makeup Remover Cleansing Wipes</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Target Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes & Face Wipes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/d33_yL7SwFoX7y_2w2q-PzWlZmI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/neutrogena-makeup-remover-cleansing-towelettes-face-wipes-931e0706fa9c40bbb1a501e8c0cefd7b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Unlike many wipes, these are both gentle on the skin and compostable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You'll need two or three to get a full face of makeup off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of how handy they are, makeup wipes can be a bit harsh, even on non-reactive skin. That said, the extra soft wipes are generously doused in a micellar-based emollient formula developed specifically to be easy and mess-free to use without compromising high-quality ingredients or nourishment. And these wipes are just about as gentle as they get while still being effective.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Ansell, these dermatologist- and ophthalmologist-tested wipes are able to clean off every trace of makeup easily — even many waterproof mascaras.

The brand shuns the typical blend of polyester, cotton, wood pulp, and rayon fabrics that make up the actual wipe, in favor of eco-friendly plant-based fibers that are compostable and biodegradable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Word to the wise: If you're a full-coverage foundation devotee, you may need to use two or three wipes to get everything off.

And of course they are: It's filled with ingredients that zero in on damaged skin and get straight to to work to repair the skin barrier at the cellular level. With a cocktail of healing heroes, like the nutrient-rich tiger grass to tend to sensitive and dry spots, hydrating kalahari melon — a fruit that is also surprisingly known to unclog pores — and redness-reducing allatonin, this product contains a whole host of anti-inflammatory properties to nurture skin. Even better, the formula contains even more soothing extracts, like licorice root, glycerin, and moringa, to help support cell turnover, which speeds up the restoration of the skin barrier, and even fights hyperpigmentation, while smoothing the overall appearance of the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a jelly-to-oil-to-milk texture, Dew Dream leaves skin feeling soft, supple, and totally healthy. As a truly excellent bonus, all of this can be yours within 60 seconds. Yes, that's how long the balm should be massaged into skin to completely remove dirt, oil, and makeup before rinsing.

Yet, choosing the right makeup remover that won’t cause or aggravate the inflammation further, but still providing a deep enough cleanse to get everything off can be a delicate balance. While many people's first instinct is to go for an oil-free cleanser, this oil by Boscia actually works wonders on rosacea, helping to gently remove makeup while sliding over skin irritation with any disturbance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unbeknownst to many, green tea is a lifesaver for various dermatological conditions, rosacea included. With antioxidants that protect the skin, you'll have a proper defense against enviornmental stressors, like UV radiation and pollution. Not only that, but it reduces the signs of rough texture, neutralizes excess sebum, and soothes the skin with its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. And this cleansing oil has it in spades, along with another rocacea whisperer, rosehip. Rich in vitamin E and anthocyanin, it's hugely beneficial to calm angry, reactive skin. It can even lighten the bright, red-colored outbreaks that are almost impossible to hide.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As the finishing touch, vitamins A, E, and D are bursting from duo of avocado and olive oils, which strengthen the skin barrier and support water retention, while Boscia's signature botanical blend of jojoba and willowherb further neutralize redness and skin inflammation. Importantly, this cleanser is formulated without harsh parabens, sulfates, chemical preservatives or artificial fragrance, which are all known irritants for rosacea.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this may sound like a lot of active ingredients for a makeup remover, it's important to keep the main goal of treating rosacea in mind: Keep the skin barrier as strong and well-maintained as possible, and reduce irritation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Oil | <strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: Rosehip, green tea, avocado, olive fruit oil, botanical amino acids, hydrangea leaf, jojoba, willowherb |<strong> Benefits: </strong>Anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, redness-reducing |<strong> Size: </strong>5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-oil-dhc-deep-cleansing-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Oil</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>DHC Deep Cleansing Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="DHC Deep Cleansing Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/71XQHhjiLy3XwxPSn-itp3XtD9I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dhc-deep-cleansing-oil-d3dff165c2304de1b5d8684067604607.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It wipes off even glitter and waterproof mascara as if by magic.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It may irritate sensitive eyes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you wear lots of SPF (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>keep it up!</a>), plus long-wear or waterproof makeup, owning a great cleansing oil is truly one of the best skincare choices you can make. Historically, those of us with oily or acne-prone skin have been told to stay way clear while oil-based makeup removers, but we’ve thankfully evolved to see the whopping benefits it provides. More specifically, the whole world has been totally wowed by this treasured oil for nearly three decades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">DHC’s Cleansing Oil delivers a shockingly deep clean with their iconic mix of olive and rosemary leaf oils that zip through pores to stir impurities, while the antioxidants from the oils protect skin from environmental stressors. For a healthy boost of hydration, the formula offers vitamin V to moisturize and nourish skin. Equally important are all the things it doesn’t include, like synthetic fragrance (although the rosemary leaf oil is naturally aromatic, but it’s subtle), mineral oil, and other irritants. And with 92 percent of participants saying that this oil worked better at removing makeup than a leading cleanser, there’s a reason you don’t mess with a classic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only caveat here is that the formula is not hypoallergenic, so those with allergies should take note.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Oil | <strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: Organic olive oil, rosemary leaf oil, vitamin E |<strong> Benefits: </strong>Softening, hydrating, strengthening |<strong> Size: </strong>6.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dry-skin-drunk-elephant-slaai-makeup-melting-butter-cleanser></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dry Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Drunk Elephant Slaai Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Drunk Elephant Slaai Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TyZEHILqJQxAmUDnDiSrODwOY1U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Drunk-Elephant-Slaai-Makeup-Melting-Butter-Cleanser--b5f24c3db2c44f958c0bc6bbbe949340.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It melts makeup away and leaves the skin soft and smooth.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s too heavy for oily skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cleansing balms are having a moment, and the same reason that so many people are obsessed with them is the same reason that many are not.

If you can get over the initial hard butter texture when you scoop it out, it transforms into a luxurious potion that could pass as a face oil, which is unsurprising, considering it’s formulated with a blend of five oils, like virgin marula oil, baobab seed oil, kalahari melon seed oil, mongongo oil, and ximenia oil. A fruit salad of various tropical extracts from kiwis, acai, blueberries, and strawberries tops off the deeply comforting formula.

"Most others sting with the intensity of an entire hornet's nest, require me to rub my eyes for longer than I should, or even worse, don't do a good enough job and I wake up with black smears of mascara all around my face. I was on a destination bachelorette party when a fellow bridesmaid convinced me to try this supposedly gentle Neutrogena option, and it's been true love ever since.

"This is very important," she says. "Cotton balls are too dense, absorb too much product, and shrink into hard little nubs, which definitely don't feel great on my sensitive eyes. A cotton round, however, never loses shape, and Tom Pecheux once told me backstage at NYFW that after they're totally soaked, just place them over your eyes like little cucumbers and they'll do all the work for you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Liquid | <strong>Active Ingredients</strong>: Aloe, cucumber extract |<strong> Benefits: </strong>Softening, soothing |<strong> Size: </strong>5.5 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Your Skin Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re following up your makeup remover with a second, different cleanser, your skin type doesn’t matter as much, according to Dr. Koo. “Makeup remover is not the same as your facial skin cleanser,” she says. “I feel makeup removers should be gentle and glycerin-based, even for oily skin. Or perhaps even more so for oily skin in order to thoroughly cleanse the pores, remove all the makeup, then followed up with an appropriate cleanser depending on your skin type.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If, on the other hand, you’re using your makeup remover as your only cleanser, you might pick differently. In this case, “for dry skin, opt for hydrating and moisturizing formulas with ingredients like glycerin or oils,” suggests Slunjski. “Oily or acne-prone skin benefits from oil-free, non-comedogenic options like water-based cleansers or micellar waters. Sensitive skin requires gentle, fragrance-free removers, such as hypoallergenic formulations.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Formula</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Makeup remover comes in oil-based and water-based variations, and it’s helpful to know the difference so you can make the right choice for you. “Oil-based removers are great at dissolving oil-based makeup because they follow the ‘like dissolves like’ theory,” explains Slunjski. “They attract and bind to the oils in makeup, making it easier to remove.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While water-based removers can be less effective at dissolving long-wear makeup, “for those with oily and acne-prone skin, a water-based makeup remover is a better option,” says Dr. Ansell, since it doesn’t add extra oil to your skin.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Your Makeup</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, you won’t need the same makeup remover if you're makeup minimalist, only wearing, for example, a skin tint and brow gel every day, versus someone who adores a full face. “For light makeup, water-based removers like micellar waters and gentle cleansing lotions work well to remove foundation, concealer, and lipstick without leaving a heavy residue,” says Slunjski. “For a heavier, full-on look, go for an oil-based cleanser. They are specifically formulated to break down and dissolve thick makeup, including heavy foundation, intense eyeshadows, and long-lasting lipsticks.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What’s the best way to remove makeup?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once you’ve selected a great makeup remover, “use a saturated cotton pad or reusable makeup remover cloth to gently wipe away makeup, focusing on areas with heavy application,” says Slunjski. “Be gentle when removing eye makeup, using a separate pad or swab soaked in remover. Finish by washing your face with a gentle facial cream cleanser to remove any remaining product and impurities.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Which makeup remover is best for acne?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To make sure a makeup remover is acne-safe, check which skin types it’s formulated for, and scour the reviews for reports that a product made people break out. But as a general rule, Dr. Koo recommends using a “water- or glycerin-based remover, but definitely without alcohol, which can strip acne-prone skin, causing irritation and even increasing the likelihood of more acne.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are makeup remover wipes bad for skin?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Makeup remover wipes aren’t bad for skin as such, but they’re also not the best, per the experts we spoke to. “Most makeup remover wipes contain more emollient-based cleansers which may be too ‘oily’ for most skin,” says Dr. Koo. “Think of it this way: You wouldn’t use toothpaste to wash your hair. The intent is to remove deeper or thicker debris, such as mascara and full cover foundation. There shouldn’t be anything harmful, but they're not ideal for skin, especially sensitive types."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, Dr. Ansell also notes that “some contain additive fragrance or preservatives that can cause allergic contact dermatitis for those with very sensitive skin. Therefore, for those who are eczema-prone or tend to have very sensitive skin, I prefer micellar water on a cotton pad to remove makeup.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Iris Goldsztajn</a> is a Paris-born, London-based freelance writer with 10 years of experience covering fashion, beauty, wellness and lifestyle for the likes of InStyle, British Vogue, Marie Claire, Cosmopolitan, and Refinery29.
