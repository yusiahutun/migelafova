<time>07 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>There’s no doubt <a href=#><strong>Whoopi Goldberg</strong></a> has worked hard for her spot as one of Hollywood’s most accomplished stars. With the success of being a beloved comedian, talk show host, actress and much more, Whoopi has accumulated quite the <a href=#>net worth</a> throughout her decades-long career. <strong>Keep scrolling to see how much money she makes.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>What Is Whoopi Goldberg’s Net Worth?</h2><p>The iconic <a href=#>View</a> star’s fortune is estimated to be valued at around $60 million, per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, and she’s also said to have a salary of about $8 million. It looks like Whoopi is going to continue making the big bucks as a CBS star, as <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> stated she signed a new contract in which she’ll appear on The View through Season 28 in 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Whoopi-Goldberg-through-the-years-2.jpg><p>Although she has a lot to brag about now, Whoopi faced many challenges at the beginning of her career. The Color Purple actress, who was born Caryn Elaine Johnson in New York City on November 13, 1955, began struggling with dyslexia at a young age while enrolled at the Hudson Guild Children’s Theater in the Big Apple.</p><p>After her learning disorder went undiagnosed for years, Whoopi slipped into drug addiction and began using heroin. In 2013, the Sister Act star <a href=#>opened up about her struggles</a> to <a href=#><strong>Howard Stern</strong></a> and revealed they went far beyond school.</p><p>Fortunately, she was able to escape her drug addiction thanks to friends, family and drug counselor<strong> Alvin Martin</strong> — whom she later ended up marrying in 1973. That same year, Whoopi and Alvin welcomed their daughter, <a href=#><strong>Alex Martin</strong></a>, before divorcing in 1979.</p><p>It was in the mid-’70s when Whoopi’s career really took off. After appearing in Citizen: I’m Not Losing My Mind, I’m Giving It Away and a few other projects, she finally got her big break in 1985’s The Color Purple. The film was nominated for 11 <a href=#>Oscars</a> and Whoopi earned a nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role for the portrayal of Celie.</p><p>Her career continued to skyrocket as she starred in other critically acclaimed films, including Jumpin’ Jack Flash and Clara’s Heart. Whoopi even won the 1991 Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing Oda Mae Brown in Ghost. Her win was monumental considering she became the first African American woman to take home the award in more than 50 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/who-is-whoopi-goldbergs-daughter-meet-only-child-alex-martin.jpg><p>Between her plethora of movie gigs, which went on to include The Lion King, The Little Rascals, The Pagemaster, Boys on the Side, Ghosts of Mississippi, How Stella Got Her Groove Back, Rat Race and Toy Story 3, Whoopi maintained a stand-up career and eventually embarked into the world of television.</p><p>In 1992, she starred on The Whoopi Goldberg Show after having appeared on Star Trek: The Next Generation and Captain Planet and the Paneteers. These roles led to appearances on Maury, <a href=#>The Roseanne Show</a>, Sesame Street, Hollywood Squares, Whoopi, Glee and many more.</p><p>Since she joined The View in 2007, Whoopi’s career has only continued to flourish. Besides making guest appearances on more shows, she has dedicated a ton of her time to supporting the LGBTQ community. In 2016, Whoopi launched a medical marijuana startup with Om Edibles medical cannabis brand founder <strong>Maya Elisabeth</strong>.</p><p>The Golden Globe winner then created a fashion line called <a href=#>DUBGEE</a> in 2019. She has also written a handful of books, including Whoopi’s Big Book of Manners in 2015, Whoopi’s Big Book of Relationships in 2019, the Sugar Plum Ballerinas series and more.</p><p>Though she is now one of the most popular daytime talk show hosts, Whoopi has continued her acting career four decades after it first began. In 2020, it was announced that she would be returning to reprise her role of Deloris in the&nbsp;Sister Act 3, slated for release on Disney Plus. The New York native is also set to star in the biographical film&nbsp;Till, set to release in October 2022.</p><p>Whoopi is not only one incredible star, she is also extremely inspiring!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6inoJ56qLvLnZmeqpdiu6bAjLCmq6yYYrWww4ymrJygXZ2utHnToZxmrKZitbC%2F02acmqqemrFw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhoopi-goldberg-net-worth-how-much-has-the-tv-host-earned.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhoopi-goldberg-net-worth-how-much-has-the-tv-host-earned.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhoopi-goldberg-net-worth-how-much-has-the-tv-host-earned.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhoopi-goldberg-net-worth-how-much-has-the-tv-host-earned.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhoopi-goldberg-net-worth-how-much-has-the-tv-host-earned.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhoopi-goldberg-net-worth-how-much-has-the-tv-host-earned.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-did-khabib-nurmagomedov-jump-the-fence-to-attack-conor-mcgregors-teammates-after-ufc-299-1294341.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-did-khabib-nurmagomedov-jump-the-fence-to-attack-conor-mcgregors-teammates-after-ufc-299-1294341.html>Why Did Khabib Nurmagomedov Jump The Fence To Attack Conor McGregor's Teammates After UFC 229?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./yellowstone-wrangler-clothing-collection.html>See the New 'Yellowstone' x Wrangler Line That's Selling Out Fast</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./yellowstone-wrangler-clothing-collection.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
