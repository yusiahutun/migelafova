In 2017, many women came to talk about the sexual harassment by chef Mario Batali. They did so on the restaurant review site known as an eater. The women who appeared in front of the media talking about their sexual harassment were at some time working as an employee for Batali. One of those women claimed that Batali had raped her after she was drugged and given alcohol in the restaurant Babbo. However, the chef refused all these allegations and it appears like fans are expecting something else from the chef, as the chef ended up having further shows with collaborators.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=uad7cbb52c391778c95157dc883f3ed4f><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>General Kenneth Mckenzie Biography</span></a><h3>Mario Batali Net Worth</h3><p>Batali is the author of 11 cookbooks out of which one has attained James Beard Award.
