The Korean concept of “in-yun” describes the fated connections between people, sometimes over many lifetimes, and is a theme that permeates through Celine Song's debut film, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pastlivesfilm.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Past Lives" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Past Lives</a>.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>In the film, Nora (Greta Lee) reconnects with her childhood friend Hae Sung (Teo Yoo) decades after she moves to Canada from South Korea, and the pair reflect on how their lives could have been had they never separated. Inspired by this reunion, one writer contemplates how we are always connected to our past selves.</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was lockdown, and my aunt was dying. I had flown home to Virginia in a rush from London, changing my plans as soon as my mum messaged me. I can’t remember the specifics, apart from “hope is low” and “there is nothing more the doctors can do”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I never knew what it meant to watch someone deteriorate until I saw my aunt in the hospital. At first, her body swelled in a way that scared me. I couldn’t touch her, fearful that she would burst. Then, once the swelling stopped, she was all bones.</p><img alt="nicole ocran in a black top, skirt and boots today, alongside a picture of her as a baby with her aunt" title="Nicole Ocran in a black top, skirt and boots today, alongside a picture of her as a baby with her aunt" width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hq-studio-canal-ac-nicole-2-64e5cd0c5585e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Nicole Ocran</span><p>Nicole and her aunt</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I don’t know what it was about being back home that made me feel compelled to call my childhood friend. It had been over 15 years since we’d last seen each other, so I wasn’t even sure if he still lived nearby. He was my best friend at high school, where we would fall in and out of love with each other – handwritten letters and burned CDs a testament to our feelings.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I got his number through an acquaintance and left an awkward voicemail.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I’m not sure if you remember me, but…”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Minutes later, he returned my call, sounding exactly the same as I remembered him. His voice had been too deep for him at 16 but suited the grown man he had become. We chatted excitedly after discovering he had moved to my neighbourhood and agreed to catch up over a drink.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It felt comfortable quickly, and I felt myself slowly slip back into my younger self. It was as if I’d never left.</p><img alt="nicole ocran in a floral dress in her 20s, alongside a film strip of images of virginia" title="Nicole Ocran in a floral dress in her 20s, alongside a film strip of images of Virginia" width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hq-studio-canal-ac-nicole-5-64e5cbcc9429a.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Nicole Ocran</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I had lived an entire life since the last time we saw each other (moved over 3,000 miles away, had multiple careers, married, bought a house, and was now separated and selling said house) but sitting opposite each other on an unseasonably warm spring afternoon, I was once again the teenage girl who would stay up all night on the phone to him. I would ask him to tell me stories as I fell asleep, comforted just by knowing he was there.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Maybe that was why I conjured him so easily in my mind. My whole world was changing. It felt like I was hurtling into my thirties and the stable ground I had built for myself wasn’t so stable after all. Death and divorce had me searching for something safe and familiar.</p><img alt="nicole ocran in a black top, skirt and boots today, alongside a picture of her as a baby with her mother" title="A still from Past Lives, showing Nora and Jung Hae Sung on a boat in New York.

The excitement of our reconnection and our unwillingness to allow the evening to end meant that we stayed up all night. I confessed to my diary the next day that we had slept together and I was unsure about what it meant (I often am) but that I was happy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We were happy, I like to think, for a while. We agreed quickly that we wanted to try and make a relationship work. After two deaths in my family, I had decided that I would move back to Virginia, wanting to salvage what was left of the life I had left there. I felt selfish being gone for so long, and now I had a long-distance relationship I had to make work.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I don’t know if it was the distance or fear – or both – but in the end, we finished things uncomfortably over WhatsApp in the middle of the night.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I still love him, in all the lives that I knew him. And all we can be to each other is what we were when we were our teenage selves, and that’s OK. The beauty of our connections and our relationships are in the moments we experience them. That doesn’t make them any less real. That doesn’t diminish what we felt at the time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Past Lives is in UK cinemas on 7th September 2023.
