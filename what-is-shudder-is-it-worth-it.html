<time>16 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>We’ve come a long way since Netflix started its first streaming services in 2007. Back then, you had to settle and watch whatever was on offer, even if it wasn’t entirely your taste. And since Netflix wanted to appeal to everyone, their selection was quite general.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, there’s a whole new world of streaming out there. There are services specifically for people who enjoy foreign films, those who like the classics, or viewers who want to focus on LGBTQ content. Shudder is one of these specialized platforms, catering to the horror buffs.</p><h2 id=what-is-shudder>What Is Shudder?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Shudder.jpg><p>So we already know that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shudder</a> is a horror streaming service. Like other popular platforms, you have to register for a monthly (or yearly) subscription to access its content. Once you do, you get to explore a vast library of horror films, TV shows, and even live channels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though this platform is dedicated to horror, there are still many sub-genres to keep you invested and coming back for more. These include Supernatural, Psychological Thrillers, Documentary, and even Comedy.</p><p>On top of its curated library of films and shows, Shudder also acts as a production company. It offers original films and even podcasts. The platform even has three live channels that run 24/7 for those who miss the old-fashion TV-watching experience.</p><h2 id=where-is-shudder-available>Where Is Shudder Available?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Shudder-originals.jpg><p>Since Shudder is quite a niche service, it is not available worldwide. Currently, only people in the US (and its territories), Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand can access it.</p><p>When it comes to the devices where you can watch Shudder, it’s pretty much across the board. The service is available through any browser, Android, iOS, Xbox, Fire TV, Roku, and even new models of Samsung TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-does-shudder-cost>How Much Does Shudder Cost?</h2><p>To get access to Shudder, you’ll need to shell out $4.45/month if you choose the yearly subscription ($56.99/year). If you want the option to <a href=#>cancel your Shudder subscription</a> quickly, you can choose a monthly subscription for $5.99.</p><p>Luckily, you don’t have to commit right away. The platform offers a 7-day trial, during which you can find out if the service is worth your money.</p><h2 id=getting-familiar-with-shudder-rsquo-s-interface>Getting Familiar With Shudder’s Interface</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Shudder-categories.jpg><p>For those who are used to Netflix, Shudder will feel quite intuitive, as it has several common features. Even if you don’t use any other streaming platform, Shudder is user-friendly and easy to navigate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First, there’s the home screen. At the top, there are featured films, mostly Shudder original productions. Underneath, there are New Arrivals, My List, Binge-Worthy, and other categories. The more movies you watch or add to your list, the better the platform will know your preferences and change the home screen recommendation accordingly.</p><p>When you hover over a title, you can either add it to your list to watch later or press <strong>Play</strong>. When you do press play, the movie won’t start right away. Instead, you’ll be forwarded to the movie/TV show page, where you can read the summary, watch a trailer, read user reviews and see the user rating. If you want to rate a movie, the only way to do it is to write a review.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Shudder-film-description.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moving on to other sections of the website, you can navigate to <strong>Movies</strong>, <strong>Series</strong>, or <strong>Shudder TV</strong>, with the top menu. The Movies page is the most versatile, offering all the different sub-genres we’ve mentioned before.</p><p>The Series page presents TV shows and podcasts but has a more limited selection. You can stream one of three live horror channels in the Shudder TV section. You can also view your full list or use the search bar to look for something more specific.</p><h2 id=is-shudder-worth-it>Is Shudder Worth It?</h2><p>Now it’s time to get into the nitty-gritty of the article and go over the pros and cons of the platform.</p><h3 id=content-available>Content Available</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Shudder-TV.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shudder currently offers over 500 titles, which is quite respectable for a platform with such a niche focus. If you add Shudder's live TV channels, even more content is available. It could take months and even years to go through all of them, and movies and shows are added every month.</p><p>When you compare <a href=#>Shudder and Screambox</a>, Shudder comes out on top because of its content. And while <a href=#>Netflix offers great horror titles</a> as well as other streaming platforms, there is no competition when it comes to Shudder.</p><h3 id=selection-of-titles>Selection of Titles</h3><p>As you can probably tell, if you’re not a horror buff, Shudder is not for you. It is also not a good platform for people who are just starting to get into horror. For instance, all-time favorites like Carrie, the Scream franchise, and Psycho, and current-day classics like Midsommer and Get Out are not a part of the library at the time of writing these lines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, movies like The Babadook, Halloween 4, and Hellraiser are included. So the library is a bit of a hit-and-miss when it comes to big titles. It’s not a perfect solution for people who want to check off a list of the greatest horror films.</p><p>However, this platform could be perfect for those who are entirely into horror. As it has a range of films, from independent titles to less familiar and foreign ones, there will always be something to dig into, especially with Shudder’s original content.</p><h3 id=interface-usability-and-accessibility>Interface Usability and Accessibility</h3><p>Shudder lacks a bit when it comes to accessibility. You can <a href=#>enable closed captions on Shudder</a>, but they're only available on select movies, and subtitles are only present in English, without the option to remove them if you find them distracting.</p><p>The video player is also not the most convenient. There is no option to change the video quality or even scroll forward and backward with the keyboard. When the movie is done, there’s also no autoplay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With that said, the interface is quite easy to navigate. There are also plenty of options for you to discover new films and shows with the collections tab and on your home screen.</p><h2 id=explore-all-that-horror-has-to-offer>Explore All That Horror Has to Offer</h2><p>To conclude, Shudder is a great choice when it comes to the horror genre. If you’re a true fanatic, it’s worth the small monthly investment. With exclusive content in both TV shows and films, you’ll always find something new to watch or even listen to (with the podcasts).</p><p>While the interface is not perfect, it is intuitive and easy enough to understand. It showcases the different movies with compelling images, and the reviews section adds another way to help you pick the most interesting thing to watch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edKhrJ2clad6qr%2BMoqtmr5%2Bnwal5yK1m</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-shudder-is-it-worth-it.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-shudder-is-it-worth-it.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-shudder-is-it-worth-it.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-shudder-is-it-worth-it.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-shudder-is-it-worth-it.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-shudder-is-it-worth-it.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-the-playstation-vr2-wont-live-up-to-the-hype.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-the-playstation-vr2-wont-live-up-to-the-hype.html>Why the PlayStation VR2 Won't Live up to the Hype</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./545883-tearful-moment-sick-kenyan-dad-screams-hugs-children-visiting-moving-video.html>Tearful Moment as Sick Kenyan Dad Screams, Hugs Children after Visiting Him in Moving Video</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./545883-tearful-moment-sick-kenyan-dad-screams-hugs-children-visiting-moving-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
