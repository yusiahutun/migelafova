Our actions generally tend to hurt the ones we adore the most, our friends. The truth is, you cannot avoid hurting the people you care most about, but what you can avoid, is making mistakes while trying to apologize to them. Before asking for forgiveness, you have to make sure that the other person knows you feel sorry for your actions. Otherwise, your apology messages will not sound as convincing as you think, because the person you seek forgiveness from will think you don’t care, but you only want to get over with it.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e2d26d7a61eb5bd3.jpg><p class=align-left>Friendship is made up of fights and arguments that emerge from the silliest things to severe misunderstandings.
