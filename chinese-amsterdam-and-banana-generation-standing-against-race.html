But a stroll down this increasingly hip street soon reveals the city’s strong Chinese presence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Chinese first began arriving in Amsterdam at the turn of the last century, mainly sailors from Guangdong hired as cheap labour, according to a book We Need Two Worlds, published 20 years ago by Professor Li Minghuan, one of China’s leading experts in diaspora studies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some of them jumped ship and settled in boarding houses near Amsterdam’s Chinatown, and found work as coal stokers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They were then followed by migrants from Wenzhou and Qingtian, peddlers of neck ties and for the latter group, soapstone statues, made popular with the Dutch aristocracy after a Qingtian man gave an incense burner with two lions playing with a pearl to the Dutch Queen Wilhelmina.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/11/03/f0d3bbf0-f891-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_972x_181706.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the recession of the 1930s, many Chinese “Amsterdamers” scraped by selling peanut cake.

In 1624, the Dutch took control of Taiwan and ruled it until 1662, when the pirate Zheng Chenggong (better known as Koxinga) swept them off the island, bringing it under Chinese rule.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Amsterdam’s Chinatown is today in the throes of gentrification.

interviewed by Wu in Banana Generation, Lee said he suffered racism growing up, getting into fist fights, but that it was worse in rural areas.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is a huge divide between big city people and small-town village people – and now we have the super racist people coming out of the woodwork and feel like

e1346ty31">“Every Chinese person that grows up in the Netherlands has this contradiction, they don’t really know who they are or who they want to be.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She said the main problem was the lack of Chinese and other ethnic minorities represented in the media.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You don’t find anywhere where you feel included in this society.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was a Chinese PhD student Xiao Wang who unwittingly exposed the undercurrent of racism in Dutch society when he entered popular TV show Holland’s Got Talent in 2013.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When he said he was going to be singing an aria from Verdi’s Rigoletto, the show’s host, Gordon, a well-known singer Dutch TV celebrity, said: “Which number are you singing? Number 39 with rice?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The cheap, unfunny gags continued after Xiao’s performance as Gordon added: “This is the best Chinese I’ve had in weeks, and it’s not a takeaway”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/11/03/43f2c4f6-f898-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_600x_181706.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His comments triggered a stream of complaints and made international headlines. Restaurants in Chinatown responded by offering a 39 per cent discount on number 39 dishes in their restaurants. To this day Gordon, has not officially apologised.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A lot of people think to be Dutch you have to have blonde hair and blue eyes,” Tsao said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Even in 2019 I have to fight against this every day - and not without a reason.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But after a sojourn in the Dutch countryside, where she was bullied and teased, on returning to Amsterdam, Tsao realised that the fast pace of the city, and its free and easy attitudes to drugs in particular, was messing up a lot of young people from all communities. In response she started her own streetwear fashion label, Sick Kids of Amsterdam.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The story of Wu, author of Banana Generation, also highlights other problems faced by young Chinese people. The son of immigrants from Wenzhou, a port and industrial city in China’s Zhejiang province, he tells of his struggle from being the “golden boy” to coming out as a gay man – a fact his family have now accepted, but not before whisking him off to China and trying to persuade him into an arranged marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/11/03/5550d892-f892-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_1320x770_181706.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I had come out of closet to parents which wasn’t great. Then my mother took me to China for a wedding of a cousin. But when we got there, she tried to match me to a potential bride,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In his book he tells of racism in the gay community, with Asians not allowed on gay dating sites and of being interviewed on a Dutch radio station and being asked: “how many Chinese eat dogs”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“From the 45 Chinese Dutchmen I spoke with, I learned that if we don’t get the life we dreamed of as small children, then we will look for it ourselves. Then, we will storm the gates of heaven and will gradually take paradise back, until people no longer see us as ‘those others’, but others see us as people,” Wu wrote at the end of the book.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have turned our shame into pride.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said the writing process also taught him to accept and understand what his parents went through, working long hours in restaurants, and why they had so little time and energy to talk to their children and help them navigate the “two worlds” that Professor Li wrote about 20 years earlier.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Chinese living in Amsterdam take on racist stereotypes</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXymwdGop55nkafBqq%2FLnmZsaGNqhHeEjpyfoqaVqLJurcysq56qlJa6bq3NnWSbmZ6Wu6J5xp6lnqqRqbawuoysq5qmlJ67qHnAoJiipqOperOtwp4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchinese-amsterdam-and-banana-generation-standing-against-race.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchinese-amsterdam-and-banana-generation-standing-against-race.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchinese-amsterdam-and-banana-generation-standing-against-race.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchinese-amsterdam-and-banana-generation-standing-against-race.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchinese-amsterdam-and-banana-generation-standing-against-race.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchinese-amsterdam-and-banana-generation-standing-against-race.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./can-you-pull-off-red-hair.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./can-you-pull-off-red-hair.html>Can You Pull Off Red Hair?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./orlando-bloom-admits-manhood-smaller-nude-paddleboarding-pic-html.html>Orlando Bloom admits his manhood is smaller than it may have seemed in THAT nude paddleboarding pic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./orlando-bloom-admits-manhood-smaller-nude-paddleboarding-pic-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
