Jason Aldean is one of them.</p><p>With hit albums such as My Kinda Party and Wide Open, Aldean is a musician who has made a major breakthrough in the music world and has captured the hearts of most country music fans to such an extent that his name cannot be easily erased despite the identity crisis the genre is inevitably struggling with. Here are interesting facts you need to know about this best-selling country music artist.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jason Aldean: Biography (Age)</strong></h2><p>First, his real name is not Jason Aldean, but Jason Aldine Williams. He was born on February 28, 1977, in Macon, Georgia, the son of his parents Barry and Debbie. Born in Nashville, Jason is an American citizen and his ethnicity is English/ Welsh. He was raised by his single mother after she was separated from his father when he was 3 years old.</p><p>Jason’s passion for music can be traced back to his early years and although his parents lived apart, they fully supported his choice of music as his future career. When he visited his father in Homestead, Florida, Jason immersed himself in guitar chords as his father served as his chord-playing teacher. Back home with his mother, Jason received all the support he needed to continue his love of music, so by the age of 14, he was already taking steps to perform on stage.</p><p>Jason’s first performance was at the local VFW hall in Macon, where he sang two of his favorite songs: Seminole Wind by John Anderson and Sticks and Stones by Tracy Lawrence. At the age of 15, his love of country music led him to join the “house band” that played at the Nashville South nightclub in Georgia.</p><p><strong>ALOS READ: <a href=#>Who Has Zendaya Dated, Who is She Dating Now: A Complete Historical Guide</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Music Career</strong></h2><p>Jason’s musical career really began after he graduated from high school at the Windsor Academy. Then he performed with his bandmate Justin Weaver at The Buckboard, the dance club of Atlanta.</p><p>The late 1990s and early 2000s were quite a challenge for the young artist, who was selected and dropped by several record companies. On November 1, 1998, Aldean decided to move to Nashville, and in mid-2000, when he was almost giving up and making plans to return to Georgia, he was signed to Broken Bow Records in Nashville, and shortly thereafter released his debut album, Jason Aldean.</p><p>On May 29, 2007, two years after the release of his first album, Jason released his second studio album, Relentless. His third, Wide Open, was released on 7 April 2009, and after the success of the first three albums, he released his fourth album My Kinda Party on 2 November 2010 and his fifth album Night Train on 16 October 2012. Between October 2014 and March 2017, Aldean had already released his sixth and seventh studio album, his eighth album, entitled Rearview Town, was released on 13 April 2018, and his lead single You Make It Easy, released on 26 January 2018, welcomed his fans into the New Year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jason Aldean’s Wife, Cheating, Divorce</strong></h2><p>Jason Aldean married his first wife Jessica Ann Ussery on August 4, 2001, and together they had their two lovely daughters Keeley and Kendyl who were born on February 14, 2003, and August 20, 2007, respectively. After some unreconciled differences, Aldean filed for divorce after being caught cheating on his wife with Brittany Kerr, a former American Idol candidate he later married.</p><p>Jason married Kerr two years after his official divorce from his first wife in 2013, Jason then engaged Kerr on September 24, 2014, and they were officially married on March 21, 2015. The couple had their first child in Memphis on December 1, 2017, and on July 10, 2018, they announced the birth of their second child.</p><p>Jason married Kerr two years after his official divorce from his first wife in 2013, Jason then engaged Kerr on September 24, 2014, and they were officially married on March 21, 2015.
