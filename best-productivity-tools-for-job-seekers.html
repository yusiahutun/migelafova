<time>05 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Finding relevant jobs and filling out lengthy application forms can be stressful. Manually doing all of this can become tedious at times. The process can be highly frustrating and takes up a lot of your valuable time.</p><p>We have compiled a list of six tools below to assist you in the job-seeking and application process. Some of these tools will filter the right jobs for you, while others will significantly reduce the time it takes to fill out your job applications. So, no matter what profession you're in, give these tools a spin.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=jobscan>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jobscan</a></h2><p>Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems to screen out the relevant candidates based on their resumes. Thus, optimizing your resume directly impacts the chance of being shortlisted by an applicant tracking system (ATS) so a human can further screen you.</p><p>Jobscan can help you optimize your resume for Applicant Tracking Systems based on the job description you are applying for. All you need to do is upload your resume and the description of the job you're applying for.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>With Jobscan, you can scan your resume for hard skills, education level, job title, soft skills, and other related keywords and find out where you might be lacking and what the match rate is.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How to Optimize Your LinkedIn Profile to Get More Clients</a></span></p><p>As Jobscan recommends aiming for a match rate of at least 80 percent, add relevant hard skills and keywords until you reach this goal. Following every scan, you'll find many tips that will help you improve your match rate.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>By the time the match rate of your resume reaches 80 percent, you have a high chance of passing the initial screening by the applicant tracking system. If you're applying for a new job, make sure you first scan your resume in Jobscan.</p><h2 id=mailtrack-io>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mailtrack.io</a></h2><p>Job seekers who frequently apply via email will find Mailtrack useful. It tracks email activity and lets you know whether an email has been opened by the recruiter or not. You can then decide whether to expect a response from them or move on to applying for another position.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The tool is free to use, and you can turn on real-time notifications and receive emails whenever one of the recruiters opens your email. The information you provide to Mailtrack is safe and secure, and Mailtrack guarantees not to sell the information to third parties.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mailtrack for Chrome</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=my-interview-practice>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">My Interview Practice</a></h2><p>My Interview Practice is an interview simulator platform holding mock interviews for more than hundreds of job professions. The questions are pre-fed, so you can conduct the interviews whenever it is convenient for you.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Unlike text-based interviews where you can only read the questions and answer them, the website asks you for access to your camera and microphone to make the interview more realistic. It also helps in reducing the pressure during your real interview.</p><p>In addition, your entire interview is recorded while you're busy responding to questions. Afterward, you can check it to see how well you've performed and filter out the areas that need improvement.</p><p>Whether you're a health professional, an IT expert, a graduate in engineering, or an artist, you'll find a sample interview on the website. Thus, you will not have to ask your friend to spare time to practice your interview.</p><p>If you're going to interview for your first job, want to overcome your fears, or would like to improve your interview skills, My Interview Practice is a great place to start.</p><h2 id=shapr>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shapr</a></h2><p>Shapr is an excellent resource for meeting new people if you lack networking skills. Shapr uses machine-learning to find 15 people with the same interests as you every day, increasing your chances of making a lasting connection. Unlike LinkedIn, Shapr eliminates the chaos.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tips to Speed Up Searching for Jobs on Indeed</a></span></p><p>By knowing that the person you're contacting has similar interests to yours, you won't have to wait hours for a reply, as with LinkedIn, where you may not even receive a response from the person.</p><p>Some of your connections may also include job seekers like you, but having a solid relationship for future references is well worth it. Apart from the aspiring professionals, you can make new friends and enjoy a cup of coffee on a Sunday evening. In your job search, Shapr can help you expand your network.</p><h2 id=livecareer-apply>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LiveCareer Apply</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/LiveCareer-Job-Apply-Extension-Auto-filling-Information-While-Applying-For-a-Job-on-LinkedIn-.png><p>Filling out job application forms every so often becomes monotonous.
